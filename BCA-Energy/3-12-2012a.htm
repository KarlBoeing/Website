The Energy Provisions reflects the ABCB objective of delivering minimum cost-effective measures.<br />
<p>Building fabric or building envelope is a term used to describe the roof, walls, windows, floors and internal walls of a home. The envelope controls heat gain in summer and heat loss in winter.<br />
Building fabric separating heated or cooled interior spaces from the exterior of the building or unconditioned spaces i.e. spaces that:<br /></p>
</li>
<li>Are habitable rooms<br /></li>
<li>Are conditioned<br /></li>
<li>Can be conditioned<br />
<p>The envelope may comprise internal or external elements. Building regulations deal with design standards for fabric heat loss, and have set minimum insulation levels in terms of elemental U values. Each element of the building envelope (roof, wall, floor, window, door) is assigned a maximum heat loss rate. The unit of measurement, Watts per square metre Kelvin (W/m²K), is an expression of  how quickly energy passes through a square metre of the element for a given temperature drop<br />
between inside and out (the Kelvin scale is quoted , but the temperature difference is practically measured in degrees Celsius). The aim is to slow down the rate of heat loss, which means a lower U value.</p>
Building fabric requirements apply to a Class 1 building, and a Class 10a building with a conditioned space.

<p><strong>3.12.5.1 Insulation of services</strong></p>
Thermal insulation for central heating water piping and heating and cooling ductwork must<br />
        (a) be protected against the effects of weather and sunlight; and<br />
        (b) be able to withstand the temperatures within the piping or ductwork; and<br />
        (c) use thermal insulation material in accordance with AS/NZS 4859.1.<br />
Explanatory information:<br />
The Acceptable Construction Manuals described in 3.12.5.0 is for use with hot water systems that provide hot water for general domestic use in areas such as bathrooms, kitchens, laundries and the like.<br />
The central heating water piping provisions apply to hot water systems designed to heat the building.<br />
<p><strong>3.12.5.2 Central heating water piping</strong></p>
Central heating water piping that is not within a conditioned space must be thermally insulated to achieve the minimum material R-Value in accordance with Table 3.12.5.1.<br />
Table 3.12.5.1 CENTRAL HEATING WATER PIPINGMINIMUM MATERIAL R-VALUE<br />
This table shows <em>'Piping to be insulated Minimum material R-Valuefor each climate zone 1, 2, 3 and 5 / 4, 6 and 7 / 8 range from 0.2 to 0.6 depending on the climate zone'.</em>
<p><strong>3.12.5.3 Heating and cooling ductwork</strong></p>
        (a) Heating and cooling ductwork and fittings must<br />
                (i) achieve the material R-Value in Table 3.12.5.2; and<br />
                (ii) be sealed against air loss<br />
                        (A) by closing all openings in the surface, joints and seams of ductwork with adhesives, mastics, sealants or gaskets in accordance with AS 4254 for a Class C seal; or<br />
                        (B) for flexible ductwork, with a draw band in conjunction with a sealant or adhesive tape.<br />
        (b) Duct insulation must<br />
                (i) abut adjoining duct insulation to form a continuous barrier; and<br />
                (ii) be installed so that it maintains its position and thickness, other than at flanges and supports; and<br />
                (iii) where located outside the building, under a suspended floor, in an attached Class 10a building or in a roof space<br />
                        (A) be protected by an outer sleeve of protective sheeting to prevent the insulation becoming damp; and<br />
                        (B) have the outer protective sleeve sealed with adhesive tape not less than 48 mm wide creating an airtight and waterproof seal.<br />
        (c) The requirements of (a) do not apply to heating and cooling ductwork and fittings located within the insulated building envelope including a service riser within the conditioned space, internal floors between storeys and the like.<br />
<em>Explanatory information:<br />
Ductwork within a fully insulated building may still benefit from insulation particularly when the system is only operating for short periods.</em>
<div class="c12"><br /></div>
<strong>Table 3.12.5.2 HEATING AND COOLING DUCTWORK AND FITTINGSMINIMUM MATERIAL R-VALUE</strong><br />
Ductwork element Minimum material R-Values in climate zones <em>'range from 1.0 to 1.5 for Heating-only system or cooling-only system including an evaporative cooling system &amp; Combined heating and refrigerated cooling system'</em>.
<p><strong>3.12.5.4 Electric resistance space heating</strong></p>
An electric resistance space heating system that serves more than one room must have<br />
        (a) separate isolating switches for each room; and<br />
        (b) a separate temperature controller and time switch for each group of rooms with common heating needs; and<br />
        (c) power loads of not more than 110 W/m2 for living areas, and 150 W/m2 for bathrooms.
<p><strong>3.12.5.5 Artificial lighting</strong></p>
(a) The lamp power density or illumination power density of artificial lighting, excluding heaters that emit light, must not exceed<br />
                (i) in a Class 1 building, 5 W/m2; and<br />
                (ii) on a verandah or balcony attached to a Class 1 building, 4 W/m2; and<br />
                (iii) in a Class 10 building, 3 W/m2, and where illumination power density is used, it may be increased by dividing it by the illumination power density adjustment factor in Table 3.12.5.3 where applicable.
