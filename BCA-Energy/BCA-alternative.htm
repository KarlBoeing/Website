        the use of artificial conditioning (heating and cooling). 
      <li>&nbsp;The sealing of buildings to reduce energy loss through air leakage. 
        Natural ventilation and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;internal air movement,

     The BCA is a performance-based code that sets out the level of performance 
        that a building or structure is to achieve. This allows cost savings in 
        building construction by: 
      <div style="line-height:4pt"><br></div>
        <li>&nbsp;the use of alternative or innovative materials and forms of 
          construction &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or designs; </li>
        <li>&nbsp;allowing designs to be tailored to a particular building; </li>
        <li>&nbsp;being clear and providing guidance on what the BCA is trying 
          to &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;achieve; and </li>
        <li>&nbsp;allowing the designer flexibility while still permitting existing 
          building &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;practices through the &nbsp;Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions. </li>
     <div style="line-height:4pt"><br></div>
      Allowing for innovation is particularly relevant in developing energy 
        efficiency measures because technologies are rapidly emerging as the community 
        and industry become more conscious of the issues.

        <b><font size="4">Alternative Solutions</font></b> 
      <div style="line-height:8px"><br></div>
      Rather than use the Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions, a designer may choose 
      to use an Alternative Solution. For this, the approval authority needs to 
      be satisfied that the Alternative Solution meets the Performance Requirements. 
      There are four means of assessing Alternative Solutions. They are:
<div style="line-height:4pt"><br></div>
        <li>&nbsp;Use of a Verification Method; 
        <li>&nbsp;Equivalence to a Deemed-to-Satisfy Provision; 
        <li>&nbsp;Evidence of suitability; and 
        <li>&nbsp; Expert judgment or opinion.</li> 
    <div style="line-height:4pt"><br></div>
	Alternative Solutions is not identified in the BCA and must be justified 
        as complying with the Performance Requirement. <br>
        Documentary evidence is required (Not identified in the BCA) but must 
        be justified as complying with the Performance Requirement<br>
        <br>
        <b>Documentary evidence</b> can be provided by 
      <li>
Registered Testing Authority report<br>
        
      <li>Certificate:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Conformity or Accreditation <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Proposed CodeMark<br>
        .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- From a professional engineer<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Issued by certification body that 
        has been accredited by JAS-ANZ<div style="line-height:4pt"><br></div>
        <li>SSL Product Listing Data Sheet for Fire Protection Equipment <br>
       
      <li> Any other form of documentary evidence<br>
        <br>
        <b>Administrative documentation</b> can be provided by
        <address></address>
      <li>Certification

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conditions <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relevant non-compliance to the 
        DTS<br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applicable Performance Requirements 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assumptions, limitations<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;References, software programs, 
        etc 
        <p align="center"><img src="AltSolu.gif" width="487" height="315"></p>
        <p> Using a Verification Method involves following a specific procedure 
          to determine whether, under the prescribed conditions, the required 
          criterion is met. For example, this criterion may be a star rating to 
          the Nationwide House Energy Rating Scheme or the energy load per annum 
          per unit area. The Verification Method can also be a procedure for determining 
          the required criterion. 
        <div style="line-height:8px"><br>
        </div>
        For energy efficiency measures, equivalence to a Deemed-to-Satisfy Provision 
        could mean analysing the subject building with the Deemed-to-Satisfy Provisions 
        and then adjusting the analysis input using the Alternative Solution. 
        Provided the estimated energy load of the Alternative Solution does not 
        exceed that of the Deemed-to-Satisfy Provision, the proposed solution 
        could be acceptable. Acceptable forms of Evidence of Suitability are described 
        in Clause A2.2 of BCA Volume One. 
        <div style="line-height:8px"><br>
        </div>
        Expert Judgment is an Assessment Method involving peer opinion and may 
        be used, for example, where the other forms of assessment are not suitable.<br><br><p align="right"><font size="-1">Karl Boeing</font>
