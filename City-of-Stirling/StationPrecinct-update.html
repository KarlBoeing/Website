<h1>The Station Precinct update</h1> 
<p>The Station Precinct Local Development Plan covers land around Stirling Station on both sides of the freeway. This area will see a major transformation and will be characterised by high rise mixed use buildings and residential areas around the Stirling Station.</p>

<p>The main problems for buildings on freeways are air pollution and noise, there is no 'safe' level for people living near freeways. There are quite a few examples (USA, Germany, Japan) where the airspace on freeways was used.</p>
<p>I called City of Stirling on 29 July 2021 and was informed, there were no specific building development-plans available for 
 <i>train station-freeway area</i>. At a Festival of Ideas (July 2009) I did discussed the concept '<i><b>building on top of freeways</b>'</i>, and also later at Stirling City Centre Alliance (SCCA).</p>
<p>However, this concept is not shown on the current plans, but is it worth to consider this idea<b>?</b> Yes it needs to be done <b><i> 'now'</i></b> before Main Roads start working on Phase two.</p>

	 <p>The coloured rectangular area shown in Figure below gives an indication of a possible a central  open space,  for community events and recreational activities.</p> 
<p><b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether it is 
 possible will depend on negotiation with State/Local Government.</i></b></p>

<p>A cost effective solution connecting communities on both sides of the freeway would be building a bridge structure (having  a light live load.)<br>(It is essential that community have access to open space, for events and recreational activities.)</p>
<p>Any comments are appreciated. Please contact me if you are passionate to discuss this significant matter.</p>
