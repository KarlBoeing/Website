      <b>Energy Conservation and Comfortable Living</b>
<div style="line-height:8px"><br></div>
       
	<li>The sun is further north in winter than in summer, and its angle is 
        much lower. This means that a simple, properly calculated, north-facing 
        roof overhang will allow the winter sun in and keep the summer sun out. 
      </li>
      <li>Dwellings should be laid out so that at least one living area (preferably 
        the one used most of the day) faces north or within 15 degrees of north. 
        An outdoor living area is also best located on the north side of the dwelling. 
      </li>
      <li>Pergolas with removable awnings or deciduous vines can be designed to 
        provide solar access for desired times in the winter while excluding solar 
        access for desired times in summer. So will pergolas with correctly angled 
        blades, called solar pergolas. </li>
      <li>The sun is most fierce in summer in the afternoon. At this time it comes 
        from the west or west-south-west, so areas of glass facing in that direction 
        should be avoided. Protect the dwelling with trees or vines (preferably 
        deciduous, so as to allow in the sun in winter), pergolas or verandahs. 
      </li>
      <li>The morning sun comes more directly from the east in summer, but will 
        generally have moved to the north and then west before the ambient temperature 
        rises. Therefore east facingwalls are not as critical as west facing, 
        but the use of glass should still be kept to a minimum, unless screened. 
      <li>The sun never hits the south face of a dwelling in winter: large areas 
        of glass on the south will allow heat to escape in winter. 
      <li>Cooling breezes in summer come to the Swan Coastal Plain from the south-west; 
        design should allow for letting these in while protecting windows from 
        the sun, and avoiding crowding shrubs so close that they will hinder breezes. 
        <div style="line-height:8px"><br>
        </div>
        All of these factors need to be verified for their relevance to other 
        regions. For example, sun angles vary significantly with latitude, and 
        the time and direction of cooling breezes varies with proximity to the 
        ocean and other factors. In the hot humid regions thorough ventilation 
        (and hence space around buildings) and shade are more important than solar 
        penetration in winter.<div style="line-height:8px"><br>
        </div>
        <b>Achieving Solar Access on Site</b>
<div style="line-height:3px"><br>
        </div>
The shape and orientation of lots sometimes make it
difficult to achieve optimum layout of a development.
Sometimes this may also conflict with the principle
of dwellings facing the street. Often a compromise
will have to be made.
<div style="line-height:3px"><br>
        </div>
It should be Council practice to assist where
necessary by making concessions in particular cases,
especially by modifying side setbacks to allow solaraccess, provided that neighbours’ privacy or solar
access is not affected. These concessions may
include building up to a side boundary.
<div style="line-height:3px"><br>
        </div>
In other cases, the only available private north-facing open space may be within 
        the street setback area. The Codes recognise this, for example by modifying 
        the provision for fencing in the street setback area to allow for private 
        outdoor living space. 
 <div style="line-height:8px"><br>
        </div>      
        <b>Protecting Solar Access for Neighbouring Properties</b>
<div style="line-height:3px"><br>
        </div>  
Development should be designed so that it does not
seriously affect solar access for neighbours. In most
cases, this means avoiding very tall walls close to
southern boundaries, so that excessive shadows are
not cast across the north-facing areas adjacent. In
some cases, overshadowing by west or east-facing
walls may also be important.<div style="line-height:3px"><br>
        </div>  
As with overlooking, but even more so, the potential
for a building to overshadow a neighbouring site, or
be overshadowed itself, varies enormously from case
to case.
