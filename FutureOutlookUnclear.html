<h1>Future Outlook is Unclear</h1>
<p>Is there a better future for mankind? That depends on whether one is an optimist or a pessimist. If we are considering all the problems of the world are we <a href="https://www.ukessays.com/essays/philosophy/the-inherint-good-and-evil-of-humans-philosophy-essay.php" target="_blank">"humans good or evil?"</a>  The question of <b>"good or evil"</b> has been debated by philosophers for centuries. Humans are originally good in nature but on earth, too many of them are aggressive and violent.</p>
<p>There is not much discussion on what kind of future we want to live on earth. The question is "How we do build a better future for all of us"?</p>
<center> 
<p>Recently I read James Scott's book<br> <i><b>"Against the Grain: A Deep History of the Earliest States"</b></i><br> and recommend it to everyone. Click on the <a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=against+the+grain+book+james+c+scott&qs=RI&pq=james+c+scott+against+the+grain+book&sc=1-36&cvid=4E3E6271EEFE461198E1216280011990&FORM=QBRE&sp=1">link</a> if you wish to buy the book (which cost $22.25).</p></center> 
<p> If you won't buy the book, it's worth Sean Illing's <a href="https://www.vox.com/conversations/2017/11/22/16649038/civilization-progress-humanity-history-technology"¬>conversation</a> with James C. Scott's. it's all about his book "Against the Grain: A Deep History of the Earliest States".</p>
<p>There is a need to act <b>now</b> and we should plan what kind of future we want. Many of us think we could continue with the current lifestyle but the outlook is more than worst as we can imagine.</p>
<h2><b> Governments, business's and scientists must urgently work together<br>to changing the world for the benefit of all people on earth.</h2></p></b>
