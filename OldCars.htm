<h1>Vintage Cars</h1>
<p>I found the following pictures by accident. All these old cars were photographed at a Berlin exhibition 
 some 45 years ago.  Unfortunately I don't know the details of the cars. It would be nice if anyone who knows more about these cars would contact me, so I can forward this knowledge to my grandkids.</p> 		
<h3>ADAC-Strassen-Hilfsdienst (roadside assistance service)<br> was established in 1928.</h3>
 
 <p><p>ADAC was originally named Deutsche Motorradfahrer-Vereinigung (German Motorcyclist Association) 
and re-named Allgemeiner Deutscher Automobil-Club	(ADAC) in 1911</p>
<p>These motorcycle cabs from the Deutsche Kraftwagenwerke Berlin-Spandau were quite popular.</p>

<p>The passengers were happy to accept the cramped transport, as the tariff was only half that of a public Taxi.</p>
<p>From 1922 to 1932 around 60,000 units were built before the cars also adjusted their tariffs downwards.</p>
