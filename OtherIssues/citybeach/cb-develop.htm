      <h2 align="center">Proposal for a development in<br>City Beach</h2>
      <h3>Introduction </h3>
	 <p> City Beach is dormitory suburb and is lacking on attractions similar to the one offered in Northbridge or Fremantle. Minor residential developments, such as in Maloney Way (19 Lots), Dampier Ave (7 Lots May 1986), and Windarra Drive (19 Lots), Marapana Road (5 Lots November 1988) as well as Truro Place subdivision at south west side on the corner Oceanic Drive /West Coast Highway in 1989, are now mostly built up. There are only a few vacant blocks left in City Beach, and the question for the Council is how can one increase the population and revenue as well as making the precinct more attractive.</p>
<p>The majority of City Beach is coded R 12.5 and only an aged persons' complex (Ocean Gardens) adjacent to Bold Park and an area at the northern side of Hale Road are coded R 30 or R 20. According to most residents there is no desire for a general increase in density. However, there is a unique opportunity for the Council to develop the vacant area on the corner West Coast Highway / Boulevard not only to allow for population grows but also to provide the residents as well as the general public with an attractive focal point. This development should be seen in conjunction with the Coastal Planning Study.</P>	
<P>Also the area bounded by Challenger Parade, West Coast Highway and Oceanic Drive need to be considered in term of its future planning</P> 
<H3>General considerations</H3>
<P>What makes it worthwhile to live in a particular suburb? Most of Perth's suburbs are sleeping dormitories, and there is a need to make suburbs more lively. Take for instance Northbridge or Fremantle - what is it about that makes these areas so special?</P>
<P>Most people who have visited Europe enjoyed the liveliness of villages, towns and cities. Here you can find the evolution from the first urban civilisations and their cities to the latest development of urban form, and the special charisma of these cities; towns or villages have a certain fascination. Northbridge and Fremantle offer similarities to a European kind live style</P>
<P>European cities, towns and villages are usually densely built-up and living and working is not separated but closely linked. That is why there is live in these cities and they are not frightening dead after business hours like our CBD's.</P>
<H3>Reasons for development</H3>
<P>City Beach is a special sought after residential area. It does not provide cheap housing but on the other hand the affordability of housing is similar to some other well-established areas within the metropolitan area and the perception of exclusiveness and expensiveness is more or less a myth. However, the characteristics that make City Beach a desirable place to live in are its central location, availability of a wide range of amenities as well as the closeness to the beaches.</P>
      <P>To create a particular Australian lifestyle and enhance the quality of living 
        in our suburb the area bounded by West Coast Highway, Chipping Road, Boulevard, 
        Templetonia Crescent, Dampier Avenue and Lowanna Way should be developed 
        as an entity integrating mixed use buildings in the development.</P>
<H3>Environmental considerations</H3>
<P>Site development will not necessarily have a detrimental effect on the environment. The area is covered with small shrubs and bushes and there are no larger trees of environmental significance found here. The area is too small for the habitat of larger animals and a bobtail or other small lizards are not often seen. This area is not really habitude by birds as the surrounding residential area with larger trees provides better surviving conditions for them.</P>
<P>The proposed development will not have a major disturbing affect on the dune landscape for people driving along the West Coast Highway. Only a portion of approximately 615 m including the Boulevard intersection on the East Side of the West Coast Highway will be affected by the development. This can be alleviated through appropriate landscaping. Sufficient open space may be left for landscaping and re-vegetation to persevere the original dune character.</P>
<P>Some kind of pollution control is advisable in denser built up areas and needs to be considered.</P>
<H3>Coastal planning scheme</H3>
<P>There is some other vacant land along West Coast Highway, which may or may not be released for development. Even if the Council has no immediate intention for a development of any vacant land along West Coast Highway, it would be most beneficial to formulate a general planning scheme for the whole coastal strip.</P>
<P>Especially as the State promotes tourist development a general planning scheme for the coastal strip would provide possible investors with an indication and extent what could be developed near the ocean in the Town of Cambridge.</P>
<H3>Development proposal</H3>
<P>The following pages give a general outlook for a proposed development at the corner West Coast Highway / Boulevard. A survey, however, is needed to obtain more information about the feasibility of the proposed development. Nevertheless, with a planning scheme in place developers can then be attracted to this area especially with the intended improvement of the beach facilities resulting from the Coastal Planning Study.</P>
<P></P>
<H3>Development boundaries</H3>
<P>The boundaries for the development proposal are shown on page 4. The development covers an area of approximately 15.76 ha. The area between West Coast Highway and Chipping Road north of the proposed area is a notable dune scenery and should not be disturbed and not be developed apart from an area of 1.43 ha (north of the Boulevard). This portion lays in a trough and the boundary ends before the slope greatly increases in steepness.</P>
<H3>Infrastructure</H3>
<P>The development area is located in a unique position. Nearly all amenities are found in close vicinity. A shopping centre is in five minutes walking distance. Children can safely arrive at Kapinara Primary School in less than six minutes, by crossing a proposed bridge structure; and City Beach Primary School is not further away than 15 minutes. The closeness of the beach is obvious. Two Senior High Schools, City Beach and Churchlands are approximately 1.5 km and 3.9 km away respectively. Boulevard Golf Complex, Bold Park Swimming pool and Reabold Hill is not further away than two kilometers. A general outlook can be seen on page 5.</P>
<H3>Housing layout</H3>
<P>An example of building arrangement is shown on page 6. This layout is only displayed to aid the Council to formulate a detailed planning scheme for this development.</P>
<P>The area along West Coast Highway is reserved for mixed used buildings with commercial, retail and residential floor space. (As tourists are welcomed to Perth tourist accommodation may be provided).</P>
<P>Apart from a dominant building in the centre which should not have a greater height than approx. 25 metres, the other buildings should not exceed three or four storeys in height so that the ocean view of the existing residences is not too much obstructed.</P>
<P>The building arrangement should consist of a series of spaces of differing size and character, and one space should naturally lead to the next ensuring continuity. These spaces or plazas, open to the sky, embellished with fountains, flowers and trees, will welcome not only the residence but also many visitors.</P>
<P>Some, cafes restaurants and pubs need to be included but should be designed preferably for middle aged and elderly people. (To avoid disturbance and vandalism, often found with alcohol consumption, a strong control of these establishments is needed. Furthermore the noise level from any source should be restricted to 70-dB (A).</P>
<P>An important feature for pedestrian and cyclists is the access to the beach provided by a bridging element across the West Coast Highway. (Alternatively a short tunnel may be built to link the development to the beach.)</P>
<P>East of the mixed used area is a residential area. It will be difficult to maintain the natural topography. Also the natural slope assist in obtaining ocean views for most houses some earthwork will be required to achieve this. The low density (25 townhouses and 35 patio houses) reflects the existing zoning. The average lot sizes for town house of 350 m² and sizes of 550 m² for patio houses seems to be relatively small but taking the open space into account the entire area could be classified as low density. The playground area on Templetonia Crescent should be extended and enhanced and the area behind the existing subdivision may be landscaped or additional houses can be positioned on it.</P>
<P>This is only a rudimentary outlay and is only a possible solution. The actual design needs to be discussed with the Council.</P>
<H3>Area zoning</H3>
 <P>The development is subdivided in four different areas as shown on Plan 7. Area A and B (approx. 8.28 ha) should be reserve for mixed uses. Restaurants, cafes and pubs need to be well planned and positioned at appropriate locations not to disturb any residence living in this mixed used zones. A level of compatibility acceptable to residents, shoppers, workers, etc. must be pursued.</P>
<P>Area C (approx. 6.11 ha) should be classified as residential zone, and it should be stressed that a low-density character is desirable, since most local residence would prefer this option. The wide-open space between to lots may be used to re-establish the dune character.</P>
<P>Area D (1.33 ha) can be use for additional housing but at this stage it is suggested to enhance and improve the area with recreational facilities.</P>
<H3>Conclusion</H3>
<P>The concept outlined in this proposal does not contain fine print details and further studies must be undertaken. This document is intended to provide a discussion paper for the Council for this special development. The site boundaries could be regarded as a guide, allowing design solutions to extend beyond the indicated boundaries if necessary.</P>
<P>The next phase would be to carry out surveys and put together appropriate documentation so that the Councils can prepare a planning scheme for the area in question.</P>

<p><b>Proposed AREA</b><br>
The area at the corner West Coast Highway and Boulevard offers a great potential for a special development.<br>
This development should be seen in conjunction with the Coastal Planning Study. Also the area bounded by Challenger Parade, West Coast Highway and Oceanic Drive should be included in the Coastal Planning Study.<br>
        The proposed development covers an area of approximately 15.76 ha and 
        will incorporate new housing, mixed uses of offices, shopping, recreation 
        and entertainment areas. An important aspect is the involvement of the 
        community, with ongoing consultation with residents, local business people 
        and other interest groups.<br>
The planning scheme ensures that no further small subdivisions will take place like the seven Lots on Dampier Avenue in 1986.

<p><center><b>Figure 2</b></center></p>
<p><b>Infrastructure</b><br>
As can be seen in Figure 3 the infrastructure is sufficient to advocate site development.<br>
Quite a number of amenities are found in close proximity.<br>
A number of facilities are in waking distance:<br>
Two Primary Schools, a High School, a Shopping Centre, the beach and a Swimming Pool in not more than 1500 m distance.<br>
The streets to the CBD are not congested and it is only a quarter of an hour drive away from the site.<br>
Public transport to the City is available (Bus route 84, 85 & 91)</p>

<p><b>Development Area</b><br>
        An essential requirement of the development is the diversity of land use. 
        In addition the coexistence of residential, commercial, shopping and community 
        uses is a vital concern<br>
The proposed development area could be subdivided into four distinct areas as shown in Figure 3.<br>
Area <b>A</b>  is approx. 6.85 ha and offers commercial and retail floor space as well as residential and possible tourist accommodation uses.<br>
Area  <b>B</b>  is approx.1.43 ha and is similar to A with some residential lots along Chipping Rd.<br>
Area  <b>C</b>  is approx.6.11 ha and is used for residential development. The lot sizes range from 340 m2 to 725 m2. The open space alleviates the compactness of the buildings and the development is not detrimental to the character of the area. All houses should not exceed two storeys in height.<br>
Area  <b>D</b>  is 1.43 ha and may or may not be used for housing. It should be contemplated to landscape this area and leave it as public open space.<br>
This is only a brief outline for further discussion.</p>

<br><br><br>
<img src="layout.gif">
<p><center><b>Figure 4</b></center></p>
<p><b>Housing Layout</b><br>
A possible housing layout is shown in Figure 4. The west side of the development area should be used as mixed development. A mixture of mutually beneficial uses in this area can be created where living, working, entertaining takes place all in all and is not separated.<br>
The middle area may be used as residential area with town- and patio houses, which give a greater sense of community than suburban-type single-family housing.<br>
The middle strip between the row houses can be reserved as public open space with a dual path for pedestrian and cyclists bridging the West Coast Highway and continues to the beach front.<br>
The Far Eastern area should be utilised as public open space and should be appropriately landscaped.</p>
