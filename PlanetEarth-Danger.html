<h2>Is Planet Earth in danger?</h2> 
</center>
<p>I wonder why the real issues that the world faces are not discussed in the media.
More significant than climate change or covid19 is the question of Survival on Earth.
Is it too late and are we beyond saving our planet Earth? 
</p> 
 
<p>The earth has not an infinite capacity to support people. A principal question is:" How many humans can Earth sustain".</p>
<p>However, people worry too much about coronavirus and climate Change (is it natural?). Urgent action is now required because business as usual needs to change.
<p>The Club of Rome predicted a <b>'future economic collapse'</b> in 1972. That was obviously pessimistic and didn't attract since the publication much attention.</p>  
 <p>As part of its year-long campaign to celebrate the 50th anniversary of &nbsp;<b>The Limits to Growth</b> (LTG) the <a href="https://www.clubofrome.org/limits-to-growth/limits-and-beyond/">Club of Rome</a> will be organising a number of global and regional events with partners, as well as a series of webinars to demonstrate the relevance of this seminal publication and the need for accelerating systems change for an equitable, sustainable and resilient future on our finite planet</p> 
<center>
<p>However, our future <b>economy and lifestyle</b> are uncertain; <br> we can't go on with the concept of <b>business as usual</b>.</p>
</center>
<p>The LTG issue has been intentionally avoided because we depended too much on the concept of growth to keep the economy running.
I recomment  "Stephen Millett's book" <a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/Managing-Future-Forecasting-Strategic-Planning/dp/1908009608"><b>Managing the Future</b></a>
<font size= -1>(A guide to forecasting and strategic planning in the 21<sup>st</sup> Century)</font> as reading resource.</p> 
 	<center>
 <p>Let's to be honest <b>"the good times are over"</b>, this is my opinion.</p>
