    <h2>Global Warming &amp; Overpopulation</h2>
<p>  The exponential  population increase on earth is a time bomb. According to the Club of Rome &ldquo;The  end of the world is omnipresent&rdquo;.  Economic  grows is only possible if the population grows as well (<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2158244017736094" title="Population-Economic Growth" target="_blank">Peterson, E Wesley F</a>). <br>
  </p>
<p>What about  our planet? <br>
  Considering the major world-problems, do following measurements   needed to be addressed: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Global warming, </li>
  <li>pollution and</li>
  <li>population grows</li></ol>
  <p>It's my belief that these issues are very important for our survivel on mather "EARTH".
  If we have on open mind for these issuse and do our own resar we'll  ome to a more informed 
  view.

    <td><p>Is global warming a natural process or man made? Many od us believe that it is significantly
less then  scientist predicts. It doesn't has a great impact on us and we don't want to heare all
these negativities. Is this true or scare mongering technic? <strong>Global warming</strong> is the  increase in  overall Earth's temperature  of atmosphere due to  <strong>greenhouse effet</strong>. This  caused levels of carbon dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons,  smoke and pollution  to increase.</p>
      <p><br>
        It's my belief that the majority of scientist  
        agree that global warming is man made and we should take drastic measurements to take reduce global warming.</p>
