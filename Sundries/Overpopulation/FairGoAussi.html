<h2>Fair Go Australia</h2>
<p>For a long time I have been worried about the injustice for
not only Australians but also for all of humanity. I thought of
three main issues as listed below. Their is
an abundance of additional inform at he on the Internet.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Reducing the impact of climate change</strong><br>
<a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/" target=

<li><strong>Gap between poor and rich</strong><br>
<a href=
"https://debatewise.org/debates/3523-governments-should-try-to-reduce-the-gap-between-their-richest-and-poorest-citizens/">
Poor and Rich</a><br></li>
<li><strong>Overpopulation</strong>, (excessive population
characterized by degradation of ecology or quality of life)
<a href=

target="_blank">Overpopulation</a></li>
</ol>
<hr>
<font size="4"><strong>Point 1</strong></font><br>
<p>Should we concern about climate change? This is still a
contentious issue. Is it natural or man made? Even some Scientist
are not agreeing about this point. The basics of climate change
must be explained in short and comprehensive terms that everyone
understands. This needs to be done before we can find a suitable
solution.<br>
What are the <a href=
"https://climatechange.procon.org/view.answers.php?questionID=001445"
title="Climate Change Pro & Con" target="_blank">positives and
negatives</a> of global warming? What is your opinion?</p>
<font size="4"><strong>Point 2</strong></font><br>
<p>The Royal Commission of the banks revealed the scandalous
behavior of the banks. Times ago the people robbed the banks
today the Banks robbed the people. Some Australian CEO's getting
some 300 times more pay then an average wage earner. It seems
these people have no moral. Changes must be made to insure all
Australians are treated fairly and equally. What are you thought?
Anything you want to say?<br>
(Please note: Some of the very rich are philanthropists, giving
away substantial sums to society)</p>
<font size="4"><strong>Point 3</strong></font><br>
<p>Is <a href=
"https://mahb.stanford.edu/blog/yes-overpopulation-problem/"
target="_blank">overpopulation</a> really a problem? This is most
important issue for humans survival on earth. Growth is a
essential concept of the economy. This makes the world go round.
We need to contemplate how long we can maintain this concept. For
comparison in 1900 the world had a population of 1.6 billion;
that has increased to <a href=
"https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/">6.9 billion</a> in 2010
 and the projection for 2050 is estimated to reach 9.8
billion. Unfortunately the earth is still the same and we can't
make it to grow. Taking this into consideration we are digging
our own graves. We need to restructure our economies. I hope that
end of growth. will come one day,.</p>

<p>The pandemic aftermath has consequences for years to come. Governments have an opportunity to improve the living conditions for all of us, whether wealthy or poor. 
Remember, people living in slums or refugee camps are worst off.</p>

<p>Some of us believe <b>"return to business as usual"</b> after the pandemic would be possible, but far from it, the COVID-19 has completely changed our lives. 
Now it's time to think about the long-term of our future. Per's Heggenes <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/06/five-pathways-to-a-better-future-after-covid-19/" target=_blank">article</a> at World Economy Forum website"5 pathways to a better future after COVID-19"
