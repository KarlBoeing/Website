  <h1>Australian sustainable issues</h1>
  <p>The recent federal election activated me to do some research on  current politics and issues on fairness and equality. In regard of the elections Labour's policies which I agreed with, but; these were not  achievable. Such drastic reform  require minutiae discussion which wasn't done. However, the Liberals will experience some difficulties in coming times. 
  <p>My mayor concerns are listed below:

  <ol>
 <li><strong>	Reducing the impact of climate change</strong><br>
<a href="https://practicalaction.org/climate-change" target="_blank">Climate Change</a></li>
   <li><strong>Gap between rich and poor is growing</strong><br>
    <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/business/workplace/divide-between-rich-and-poor-in-australia-is-growing-20170203-gu5bkw.html">Poor and Rich</a><br>
<li><strong>	Overpopulation</strong>, (excessive population characterized by degradation of ecology or quality of life)
<a href="https://www.overpopulationawareness.org/en/" target="_blank">Overpopulation</a>
</ol>
  <font size="4"><strong>Point 1</strong></font> (Comments)<br>
 <p>Should we  concern about climate change?  This is still a contentious issue. Is it natural or man made? 
 Even Scientist are not agreeing about this point. 
 The basics of climate change must be explained in short and comprehensive terms that everyone understands. 
 This needs to be done before the Liberals can offer a suitable solution. <br>
 What are the <a href="https://climatechange.procon.org/view.answers.php?questionID=001445" title="Climate Change Pro & Con" target="_blank">
   positives and negatives</a> of global warming? What is your opinion? </p>
   <font size="4"><strong>Point 2</strong></font> (Comments)<br>
  <p>The Royal Commission of the banks revealed  the scandalous
  behaviour of the banks. Times ago the people robbed the banks today the Banks
  robbed the people. Some Australian CEO's getting some 300 times more pay then an everage wage earner. It seems these people have no moral. 
  Changes must be made to insure all Australians are treated fairly and equally. 
    What are you thought? Anything you want to say?<br>
	(Please note: Some of the very rich are philanthropists,  giving away substantial sums to  society)</p> 
	<font size="4"><strong>Point 3</strong></font> (Comments)<br>
	<p>This is most important issue for humen survival on earth
