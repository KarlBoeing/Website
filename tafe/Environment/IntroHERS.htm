1stRate5® is an easy-to-use interactive tool with a graphic user interface that enables designers and thermal performance assessors to generate energy ratings for a home by tracing over floor plans. The software integrates the AccuRate calculation engine to estimate the annual heating and cooling energy and can be used to rate an existing design or as an interactive tool to optimise the design beyond compliance.

The <a href=:"https://store-n1gksvan.mybigcommerce.com/login.php?from=account.php%3Faction%3D">BERS</a> (Building Energy Rating Scheme) computer program is a powerful tool that is used to simulate and analyse the thermal performance of Australian houses in climates ranging from Alpine to tropical. BERS is a Home Energy Rating Scheme that can be used to assign a star rating to a house within a particular climate type. It is used to simulate the thermal performance of Australian houses in climates ranging from Alpine to tropical.<br>On the 1st February 2017 BERS Pro v4.3.0.2 (3.13) was released marking the end of the full and formal accreditation of BERS Pro 4.3.0.X by the NatHERS administrator.
