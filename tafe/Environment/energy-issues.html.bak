      <h2>Earth - Sun relationship</h2> 
      <p>The  diagram below shows the relationship between the Earth and the sun. This  relationship influences  the season of the year. Watch the link <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9hawBb3wbk" " target="_blank"><font color="000">youtube video</font></a> to see the orbit of the earth around the sun.
      <p>To utilise the sun's energy you must be aware of the sun's 
        movement for the particular latitude.</p>
		
      <p>The earth moves around the sun in a slightly elliptical orbit. A revolution 
        around the sun takes 365 days and 5.8128 hours. The orbit results from 
        the gravitational pull of the sun.</p>.

              <h2>Figure 1</h2>
          
      	
				
 
	 <p> As can be seen from Figure 2 the area receiving the maximum intensity of 
      the sun moves north and south between the tropic of cancer (latitude 23.5&deg;N) 
      and the tropic of Capricorn (latitude 23.5&deg;S). This causes the seasonal 
      changes. On the 21 March and 21 September areas along the equator are normal 
      to the sun's rays. These are the equinox days (day and night of equal length.</p>

     <p>When the southern hemisphere is tilted towards the sun, 
        we have summer and when tilted away from the sun, we have winter. As can 
        be seen in Figure at noon the sun appears higher in the summer sky then 
        in the winter sky.</p>

      <h2><a name="sec1">Location specific requirements</a></h2> 
     
	<p>Choosing a site is by far the most important aspect of building 
        a new home. In order to create a passive solar house, there should if 
        at all possible be access to north sunlight, with enough room away from 
        neighbours to allow for sunlight to penetrate the north-facing rooms in 
        winter when the sun is at its lowest. For lifestyles that focus on outdoor 
        entertaining, gardening or recreation, a north facing back yard is the 
        most preferred option.</p>
        <p>There are ways to overcome a lack of north aspect and still get some solar 
        gain including clerestory windows, skylights, internal terraces and suntraps, 
        balconies, roof structures&#133;<p>
		
      
            <div align="center"><img alt="sun-data-color (71K)" src="sun-data-color.jpg" height="483" width="602" />
              <h2>Figure 2</h2>
         
   
	 
      <p>A site location will affects comfort and energy bills. Orientation of the 
      house within 30&deg; of due south is a basic but fundamental principle of passive solar design to maximise
        solar gains. The south facade should also be free from overshadowing by trees or other buildings, especially when
        the sun is at a low angle during winter. If the site does not provide ideal 
        conditions for local climate, it's feasible to modify it with appropriate 
        landscaping. For example, in a cold climate, one can plant trees as protection 
        against winter winds, and in a warm climate one can use trees to channel 
        cooling breezes into your house and provide shade.</p>
     

If the site is sheltered from the wind heat loss from the building will be reduced. 
      Sites at higher level will be colder than sites at sea level. Site location 
      is important if considering making use of solar gains.

<h2><a name="sec2">Passive Solar Design</a></h2>
        <p>The principal objective of <a href="http://www.consumerenergycenter.org/residential/construction/solar_design/"><font color="#000">Passive Solar Design</font></a></p> 
<p>(PSD) is to provide a building with a comfortable and healthy indoor environment at 
      low energy and environmental cost. It relies on the careful application 
      of the following principles during the design and the construction of the 
      building:</p>
			<p>
			<ul>
      <li>making provision for solar gains and avoiding heat losses so as 
        to minimise the use of heating;</li>
      <liproviding access to daylight to reduce the need for artificial 
        lighting;</li>
      <li>using natural ventilation to avoid dependence on mechanical systems, 
        especially air-conditioning;</li>
      <li>providing efficient and responsive heating and lighting systems.</li></ul> 
     	</p>
       <p>High thermal mass construction in regions with significant diurnal ranges.</p> 
        
        <p>Low thermal mass construction in regions with low diurnal range. 
        Use of light coloured roofs and walls to reflect more solar radiation 
        and reduce heat gain.</p> 
	 
        <h3>Passive solar cooling</h3>
         <p> A primary strategy for cooling buildings without mechanical assistance 
      in hot climates is to employ natural ventilation. It is the least expensive 
      means of cooling and appropriate for all Australian climates. In the Perth 
      area, prevailing summer breezes are from the southwest.</p> 
     
		
      <h3>Passive solar heating</h3> 
    
      <p>Primary elements of passive solar heating are: <ul>
     <li>North facing glass </li>
      <li>Thermal mass to absorb, store, and distribute heat</li> 
      <li>Minimising heat loss with insulation</li></ul>
        <p>There are three approaches to passive systems - direct gain (thermal mass), 
        indirect gain (Trombe Walls) and isolated gain (sun-room). The goal of 
        all passive solar heating systems is to capture the sun's heat within 
        the building's elements and release that heat during periods when the 
        sun is not shining. At the same time that the building's elements (or 
        materials) is absorbing heat for later use, solar heat is available for 
        keeping the space comfortable (not overheated).</p>

        <h2><a name="sec3"><b>Natural Ventilation</b></a> (Air movement)</h2>
       
        <p>It is left up to natural forces to direct the air through the building. 
        The building form and construction determines the relative strength of 
        these natural forces. This basically comes down to the size and location 
        of air inlets and outlets as well as any ability to capture or funnel 
        prevailing breezes. Understanding the wind patterns of the region helps 
        to design a home that takes advantage of the refreshing breezes. This 
        will affect the choices about window size and placement, and roof shape.</p>
      
        <p>The design of <a href="http://www.wbdg.org/resources/naturalventilation.php">natural 
        ventilation</a> systems requires identification of the prevailing wind 
        direction, the strategic orientations and positions of openings on the 
        building envelope.</p> 
        
     <p> <b>Guidelines for natural ventilation.</b></p> 
      <ul>
      <li>Increase natural ventilation by reducing barriers to air paths 
        through the building.</li>
      <li>Topography, landscaping, and surrounding buildings should be 
        used to redirect airflow and give maximum 
        exposure to breezes.</li>      
      <li>Provision of fans to provide ventilation and air movement in the absence of breezes.</li>      
      <li>Floor plan zoning to maximise comfort for daytime activities and sleeping comfort.</li>      
      <li>Appropriate windows and glazing to minimise unwanted heat gains and maximise ventilation.</li></p></ul>

        <h2><a name="sec4">Assess building design</a></h2> 
      <p>The thermal behaviour of a building is basically a function of its form 
        (architecture), its construction (materials and workmanship), local macro 
        and micro-climate conditions, and by its use. However, an objective of 
        the BCA is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by efficiently using energy 
        and to encourage superior design and construction methods by eliminating        
			 'worst practice'</p>
				The energy efficiency measures for houses 
        (Class 1 &amp; 10) were established in the BCA in 2003 (Volume 2), and 
        for multi residential buildings (Class 2-4) in May 2004 (Volume 1).</p>
       <p>The most common method to assess the energy efficiency of buildings is the use of house energy rating software.</p>
