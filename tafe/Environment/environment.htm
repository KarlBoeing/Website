        Environmental design issues</font></p>
      <p align="left"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#404040">If 
        you are not conversant with basic design requirement and you need to discuss 
        a design of a proposed extension, alteration or new building you should 
        contact Boeing Consulting. We can give advise on any matter relating to 
        design, incorporating issues such as low energy.</font></p>

        conservation</i></a><font color="#404040"> is an issue that needs 
        to be a primary concern not only of the governments but of everybody.</font></font></p>
 
      <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2" color="#404040"> The Building 
        Code of Australia<a href="http://www.abcb.gov.au" target="_blank"><i> 
        (BCA)</i></a> has introduced minimum energy 
      performance requirements to reduce energy consumption.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2" color="#404040"> A lot of energy 
        is used for space heating and cooling. The three main energy sources used 
        in residential buildings are electricity, natural gas and wood. Greenhouse 
        gas emissions resulting from end uses depend not only on the relative 
        efficiencies of the appliances themselves, but also on the thermal performance 
        characteristics of the building shell in which they operate. The amount 
        of energy used over the life of a dwelling depends largely on its design 
        and materials, and other factors determined at the time of construction. 
        </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2" color="#404040">Energy Star-rating 
        is used to take advantage of of the building envelope as a modifier of 
        climate. Improvements in the thermal performance characteristics of the 
        buildings will result in a reduced demand for both heating and cooling. 
        AS 2627.1-1993 Thermal insulation of dwellings, should be contemplated 
        at the design stage. A large amount of energy is lost through windows. 
        A new 'window energy rating scheme' <a href="http://www.awa.org.au" target="_blank"><i>WERS</i></a> 
      is being implemented improving the energy performance of windows. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2" color="#404040"><a href="passive-energy.htm" target="_blank">Passive 
        solar energy</a> strategies should be used to reduce the amount 
        of energy needed. Passive systems are associated with low costs. The interior 
        climate is the result of the building configuration as related to the 
        exterior, and the way people use the building. </font> 
      <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2" color="#404040">A sound understanding 
        of the physical properties of the material is needed to select the most 
        advantageous materials. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="arial" size="2" color="#404040">Local building 
        material should be used to minimise the cost of transporting energy. Thermal 
        storage capacity of building materials, natural ventilation, orientation, 
        building form and vegetation are important design considerations not only 
        for architects but also for builders and the public in general. </font></p>
