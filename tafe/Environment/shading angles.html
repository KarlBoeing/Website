      <p>The purpose of climatic design is to facilitate an increase in the energy 
        efficiency of buildings. Thermal design improves the living and working 
        environment for occupants through ecologically sustainable means. It also 
        seeks to reduce the effect on public health by adverse climatic conditions.</p>
      <p>Climatic design issues are now incorporated in Residential planning codes 
        and Building Code of Australia. </p>
      <p><b>Climate Zones</b><br>
      Australia is a large country with three very different different climates 
        -tropical, arid and temperate.<br>
        Regional climate zones are particularly significant for the design and 
        construction of buildings.<br>
      The map from the Bureau of Meteorology below shows these climate zones 
        with sub groups.</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="climate1.jpg" width="593" height="428"></p>
      <p>According to the BCA (Volume 2) Figure 1.1.4 Australia is divided into 
        eight (8) climate zones for the puposes of thermal design of a building. 
        Table 1.1.2 list climate zones for cities of other various locations.</p>

      <br>
      Because buildings are not fully sealed, outside conditions have a significant 
      influence on the climate inside the building. The building's style, the 
      materials used, the state of repair of the building and whether the building 
      is insulated, air-conditioned or without either, all influence the impact 
      outside conditions have on the climate inside the building.<br>
      <br>
      <h4>Macro and Micro Climate</h4>
      <p>Climate change is the greatest environmental threat the world faces today. 
        It is caused by emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide. 
        Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is a by-product of our use of energy, 
        and therefore by cutting energy consumption we automatically reduce total 
        CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. </p>
      <p></p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Macro climate:</b> large-scale climate, of a large area or country. 
          Climate of this type is not easily modified by human efforts. However, 
          continued pollution of the Earth, its streams, rivers, and atmosphere 
          make human actions necessary. The climate of an area is the combination 
          of conditions that will most likely occur there. The conditions that 
          usually influence the climate include: temperature, rainfall, latitude, 
          and topography etc. </li>
        <li><b>Micro climate:</b> small-scale contrasts, such as between hilltop 
          and valley or between buildings and a surrounding area. They may be 
          of an extremely small scale, such as one side of a hedge contrasted 
          with the other. Climate in the microscale may be effectively modified 
          by relatively simple human efforts.</li>

        Climate</font></a> from the University of Strathclyde's Energy Systems 
        Research Unit ESRU's web site.</p>
      <p>There are many sources of energy available locally within a building 
        site. These include direct and diffuse radiation from the Sun, air movement 
        from winds and temperature differences.</p>
      <p><b>Buildings designed for climate</b><br>
        Climatic design is practiced throughout the world and has been shown to 
        produce buildings with low energy costs, reduced maintenance, and superior 
        comfort. 
      <p>Some of the designfeatures are outlined below:
      <ul>

        <li>Utilising climatic factors may not require mechanical heating or cooling. 
        </li>
        <li>Homes that are passively designed take advantage of natural energy 
          flows to maintain thermal comfort. <font size="-1">(Well designed envelopes 
          maximise cooling air movement and exclude sun in summer, trap and store heat from the sun in winter and minimise heat loss to the external environment.)</font> 
        </li>
        <li>Building envelope is a term used to describe the roof, walls, windows, 
          floors and internal walls of a home.. </li>
        <li>Maximise the thermal comfort and minimise the need for energy reliant 
          heating and cooling appliances to achieve accepted levels of thermal 
          comfort.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>There are many Internet site which identify key actions that can be undertaken 
        to save energy. Actions may be divided up into different areas (such as 

        heating, lighting etc.). In Table 1 below you find some links to Internet 

        sites that will be of interest to you.</p>

      <p>The "Residential Design Codes of Western Australia" requires buildings 

        to be design for climate. Protecting solar access for neighbouring properties 

        is an important design criteria. Excessive shadows should not be cast 

        onto adjacent properties.  The calculation of overshadowing 

        for particular month and times of the day can be determined from sun charts. 

        (The sunchart is a map of the sun's path across the sky during the year 

        and maps out the sun's position as a function of day and time.) There 

        are two types of sun charts:<br>

        <br>

      <p>Figure 1 &amp; 2 show two typical suncharts for Perth 31.97&deg; south 

        latitude. These suncharts map out the sun's position in the sky (vertical 

        and horizontal shadow angles). For the location of the sun's position 

        you need two coordinates, the <b>altitude </b>(vertical) and the <b>azimuth</b> 

        (horizontal) angle. The altitude angle (angle of elevation) measures the 

        sun's location in the sky above the horizon. <br>

        Figure 1 (cylindrical sunchart) shows the azimuth angle in degrees east 

        or west of due North (southern hemisphere). Angles being positive due 

        east and negative for western angles. <br>

        Figure 2 (polar sunchart) shows the azimuth as compass bearing, relative 

        to direction north. Azimuth angles range from 0 degrees (north) through 

        90 (east), 180 (south), 270 (west), and up to 360 (north again). </p>

      <p>The cylindrcal sunchart seems to be easier to use. The University of 

        Oregon has a program that creates cylindrical suncharts for any location 

        on the earth. Use these <a href="http://solardat.uoregon.edu/SunChartProgram.html">suncharts</font></a> 

        to determine the altitude and azimuth angle for your assignment.</p>

      <p>Templates will be provided to record the appropriate data (see Table 

        1). They include longitude and latitude angles for various WA locations.</p>
