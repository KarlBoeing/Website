Injuries to inexperienced workers account for one third of the total injuries to Australians at work. A major cause of these injuries is inadequate training of new employees and apprentices.
<div style="line-height:3px"><br></div>
Failure of employers to provide adequate information, instruction, training and supervision to new employees or apprentices is a breach of Section 19(1)(b) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act. Adequate training must be completed before employees or apprentices start work and are exposed to hazards.
<div style="line-height:3px"><br></div>
In cases where inadequate training places new workers at considerable risk, employers are likely to face prosecution by WorkSafe Western Australia.
<div style="line-height:3px"><br></div>
Under Section 19(1)(a) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, employers have a duty to ensure, as far as practicable, that employees are not exposed to hazards at the workplace.

      <li>The Blue/Green Card is mandatory and heavy financial penalties are specified by the regulations for &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;non compliance. 
<div style="line-height:3px"><br></div> 
WorkSafe inspectors are enforcing the construction safety <a href="http://www.commerce.wa.gov.au/WorkSafe/Content/Industries/Construction/Further_information/Construction_induction_training.html">induction training</a> laws.

        <b>Blue/Green Card Training</b> 
        <div style="line-height:3px"><br>
        </div>
        The Construction Safety Awareness Card (Blue/Green Card) is a compulsory card in WA and other states if you wish to work in the building and construction Industry. 
        <div style="line-height:3px"><br>
        </div>
        There are many Registred Training Organisation (RTO's) who offer training courses. 
The cost of the Blue Card varies and depends on the RTO  who provides the training. However if you work in the WA building and construction industry you may be able to claim for a subsidy to reduce the actual course cost. The subsidy is supplied by the Building and Construction Industry Training Fund <a href="http://www.bcitf.org/">(BCITF)</a>.  
        <div style="line-height:3px"><br>
        </div>
        Mutual recognition arrangements have already been in place for some time. Mutual recognition of construction induction cards will further enhance the capacity of construction workers to move across state boundaries without the requirement to undertake construction induction training in each state.
