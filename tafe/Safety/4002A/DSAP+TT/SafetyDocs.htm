<strong><span style="font-size:14pt; "><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Occupational Safety and Health Act</span></span></strong>
                    <div style="line-height:4px"><br /></div>
The principal objective of the OSH Act is to promote, secure the safety and health of persons in the workplace and protect persons at work against hazards (see section 5 of the Act).
                    <div style="line-height:9px"><br /></div>
<span style="font-size:14pt; "><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Occupational Safety and Health Regulations</span></strong></span>
                    <div style="line-height:4px"><br /></div>
Regulations have the effect of spelling out the specific requirements of the legislation. Regulations may prescribe minimum standards and have a general application or they may define specific requirements related to a particular hazard or particular type of work. They may also be for the licensing or granting of approvals, certificates etc.
                    <div style="line-height:9px"><br /></div>
                    <div style="font-size:14pt; "><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Australian &amp; Australian/New Zealand Standards</span></strong></div>
                    <div style="line-height:4px"><br /></div>
There are a number of standards referred to in the regulations. If a standard is listed in a particular regulation then compliance with the mentioned standard is mandatory.
                    <div style="line-height:9px"><br /></div>
                    <div style="font-size:14pt; "><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Codes of Practice</span></strong></div>
                    <div style="line-height:4px"><br /></div>
A code of practice is defined in the Act as a document prepared for the purpose of providing:
                  
    <div style="text-indent:30px">                              <li>practical advice on preventive strategies; and</div>
   <div style="text-indent:30px">                     <li>a practical means of achieving any code, standard, rule, provision or specification relating to occupational safety or health in Western Australia.</div>
      <div style="line-height:4px"><br /></div>               
A code of practice may contain explanatory information.<br /> The preventative strategies outlined in a code of practice do not represent the only acceptable means of achieving the standard to which the code refers. A code of practice does not have the same legal force as a regulation and is not sufficient reason, of itself, for prosecution under the Act
                    <div style="line-height:9px"><br /></div>
                    <div style="font-size:14pt; "><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Guidance Notes</span></strong></div>
                    <div style="line-height:4px"><br /></div>
The next tier in this process comes in the form of guidance notes prepared by the WorkSafe Western Australia Commission. A guidance note is an explanatory document providing detailed information on the requirements of legislation, regulations, standards, codes of practice or matters relating to occupational safety and health as approved by the Commissioner.
