        <p>This Unit is computer based and can
          be studied in three modes </p>
        <ol start=1 type=1>
          <li>internally in Class if you have no Internet access or not
            a computer ,</li>
          <li> externally at home
            (work) if Internet access is available, and </li>
          <li>as a
            combination of the above.</li>
        </ol>
          Students enrolled in this unit don't need to come to every class but must access   the course <strong>every week for 1.5 hours</strong>.<BR>
        Students failing to do this may be taken off the course and access to the course is then denied. You need to re-enrol! 
        
 <div style="line-height:4px"><br></div>
          
       Class attendance is not
          required. However, if you study at home or work and need any clarification on an
          issue you should attend class and discuss the matter with your lecturer. 
      
        From time to time there may be a compulsory class attendance required. The date for the compulsory attendance will be announced on the home page of the web site. 
        <p>Figure 1 shows an portion of the home page indicating how to access course information. </p>

        <p class="style1">Figure 1</p>
        <p style='line-height:normal'>There are two options to
          navigate through the course as shown in Figure 1:</p>

        <p style='line-height:normal'>The easiest and
          quickest way to access information is using Expand Course Content in the menu
          side-bar as shown in the figure above. If the double arrow pointing north the
          Course Content is expanded and if they pointing south you need to click on them
          to expand (showing headings) If you click on the + shown left of the heading then
          all subheadings will be shown (see Figure 1 &amp; 2).</p>
        <p style='line-height:normal'>As mentioned before
          you can also click headings on top of the home page (Your Location-bar) to
          access unit topics. You can go back to any section topic that is shown on this bar
          at the home page (see Figure&nbsp;2). </p>

              construction workplace.
            You will identify hazards  that have the potential to cause harm (injury, disease, death, property and   equipment damage). Analysing statistical data will give an indication of the major safety risks in the workplace.  Any risks identified a  in your workplace must be controlled. There is a specific order of control that you must know of. The principles of risk management need to be understood.            If you finished the study

        assessment a '<em>Workplace Inspection Repor</em>t'. Students who are not working on a construction site  to carry out a hazard inspection may use the college ground/building for your hazard/risk
            identification assessment. More information is provided in Element 2 document. Other workplace inspection arrangements need to be discussed with your
            lecturer. 
          A link to a safety inspection  template (doc-file and pdf-file) for the college site safety inspection is provided.<br>

          A Job Safety Analysis (JSA) is 
         the systematic identification of potential hazards in the work place by personnel as a   first step to controlling the possible risks involved.
          In a JSA, each basic step of the job is examined to identify potential hazards and decide on the safest way to do a job. There is an JSA exercise for three to five students who like to work together.  If you not attending class use the <span class="style2">Mail</span> to communicate with each other.</li>
