The principles of risk management are central to systematically managing Occupational Safety &amp; Health . Risk management is made up of the following steps:
                    <div style="line-height:3px"><br /></div>
1. Identify the hazards.<br />2. Assess the risk(s) to the safety, health, and welfare of persons posed by the hazards.<br />3. Use appropriate control measures to eliminate or control the risk.<br />4. Review the control measures that have been put in place from time to time to ensure they remain     appropriate.
                    <div style="line-height:3px"><br /></div>
Consultation is also an essential part of every step in the risk management process. Following consultation, an employer should implement appropriate control measures based on their risk assessment.
                    <div style="line-height:12px"><br /></div>
An employer should also consult their employees after the occurrence of an injury, illness or incident to review why the control measures may have failed and to identify any necessary changes to the measures in place for controlling risk.
                    <div style="line-height:6px"><br /></div>
Possible questions might include:
                    <div style="line-height:3px"><br /></div>
• What factor(s) contributed to the injury, illness or incident?<br />• Could the injury, illness or incident have been prevented?<br />• Should the employer’s safety procedures and systems have prevented the injury, illness or incident?<br />        - If no, what needs to be changed?<br />        - If yes, why didn’t the OS&amp;H system prevent the injury, illness or incident?<br />• What can be done to prevent the injury, illness or incident from recurring, and when?

<strong>The essence of risk management</strong>
                    <div style="line-height:6px"><br /></div>
<strong>Think</strong> about what may affect employees’ health, safety or welfare (identify hazards and assess the risks they pose).
                    <div style="line-height:3px"><br /></div>
<strong>Talk</strong> with employees (consult about matters that may affect employees’ health, safety or welfare).
                    <div style="line-height:3px"><br /></div>
<strong>Do</strong> what is necessary to make the workplace safe (implement risk controls).
                    <div style="line-height:3px"><br /></div>
<strong>Review</strong> and monitor OS&amp;H measures (ensure risk controls are effective).

The five step risk management process is:<br /> <strong>Preparation</strong><br /> * define the context<br /> * identify activity/task/work area/personnel to be assessed<br /> <strong>Step 1: Identify all hazards by:</strong><br /> * observing, inspecting, investigating, communicating and consulting; and<br /> * making a record of the hazards identified.<br /> <strong>Step 2: Assess the risks these hazards create by:</strong><br /> * assessing and prioritising the risks;<br /> * dealing with the highest priority risks first; and<br /> * dealing with less risks or least significant risks last.<br /> <strong>Step 3: Decide on measures to control the risks by:</strong> <br /> * eliminating the risk;<br /> o if elimination of the risk is not possible, select these control measure in the following order of preference -<br /> 1. substitution;<br /> 2. isolation (not administrative);<br /> 3. minimisation by engineering means;<br /> 4. application of administrative measures; and<br /> 5. use of personal protective equipment (PPE).<br /> <strong>Step 4: Implement appropriate control measures should:</strong><br /> * adequately control the risks;<br /> * not create other risks; and<br /> * allow workers to do their work without undue discomfort or distress.<br /> <strong>Step 5: Monitor the control measures and review the process:</strong><br /> <strong>A: Monitor</strong><br /> * Have the control measures been implemented as intended?<br /> * Are the control measures adequate?<br /> * Did the implementation of control measures create other hazards or risks?<br /> <strong>B: Review</strong><br /> * Has anything changed over time since the risk process was implemented?<br /> * Is the control of risks still adequate?<br /> * Was the risk management process conducted effectively?<br /> The five steps can be applied in all types of workplaces, but in some cases it may be more effective to perform more than one step at a time. The way the risk management process is implemented can depend on the type of business activity and tasks involved at the workplace. For example, a small business may deal with its hazards differently to a very large business.
