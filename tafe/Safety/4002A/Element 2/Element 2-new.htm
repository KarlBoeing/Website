     Safety<b> inspections</b> are the "First Step" to get started with identifying all the things that could lead to injury or harm to the health of you or your employees, or at worst that could lead to a death occurring in your workplace. It explains some common hazards found in most workplaces.     
      <div style="line-height:3px"><br>
      </div>
      You are probably  aware of the ThinkSafe campaign mascot, ThinkSafe SAM, on TV advertisements, posters and billboards promoting ThinkSafe. The idea is to get everyone using the three ThinkSafe SAM steps to stop accidents. 
      <div style="line-height:3px"><br>
      </div>
The three ThinkSafe SAM steps are easy to remember because they stand for ThinkSafe SAM's name: 
   <div style="line-height:3px"><br>
      </div>

      
      <b>• <span class="style3">S</span>pot the hazards </b>(…in your workplace);         
      <div style="line-height:3px"><b><br>
      </b></div>
      <b>• <span class="style3">A</span>ssess the risk</b> (…of injury, harm to health or death occurring); and      
      <div style="line-height:3px"><br>
      </div>
      <b>• <span class="style3">M</span>ake changes</b> (…that eliminate or reduce the risk).     
      <div style="line-height:6px"><br>
      </div>
 If you have  taken the "First Step", you should consider  how to manage the     
          hazards in your workplace, assist you to improve your performance and 
          help you take the "Next Step". You have to know the hazards to complete the next step  to writing a safety plan.
<div style="line-height:6px"><br>
      </div>
		  Do you know what hazards are in your workplace?   <div style="line-height:3px"><br>
      </div>
• List your main work activities.<br>
• Break the work activity into basic steps (or tasks).<br>
• Identify and write down the hazards for each work activity.<br>
• Get expert advise from people in your workplace doing  work activities.<br>
• Use safety and health information in codes of practice, standards, material
safety data &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sheets, information from suppliers of plant and other industry
sources.<br>
• Use information from your records of work-related incidents (including
property &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;damage and near misses), injuries and diseases.<br>
• Carry out inspections of your workplace.    <div style="line-height:9px"><br>
      </div>
      <b><font size="4">Workplace Inspections</font></b> <div style="line-height:3px"><br></div>
        Inspections are a good way to identify hazards and issues specific to your work environment and activities. You can either develop your own inspection checklists covering all work areas and tasks carried out in your business, or you can use a checklists and Hazards, Risks and Controls forms.<br>
        Some items you may include in your inspections are:<br>
        o Housekeeping - floors, work benches, ladders, walkways.<br>
        o First aid and amenities - first aid equipment, supply of drinking water, suitable washrooms and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;toilets.<br>
        o Fire and emergency safety - access and exits, firefighting equipment, alarm systems.<br>
        o Plant and equipment - cutting, crushing, or trapping hazards and unsafe conditions due to things &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like pressurised contents, flying particles, noise, hot or cold parts.<br>
        o Chemical hazards - personal protective equipment, ventilation, labels, containers, storage, signs,  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and material safety data sheets.<br>
        o Electrical - residual current devices (RCDs), the condition and location of cables, plugs, sockets  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and switches, tag/lock out.<br>
        o Ergonomic and manual handling - the design of work stations, height of bench tops and desks, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seating, tasks involving lifting, carrying, reaching, stretching and repetition.<br>
        o Machinery guarding - barriers, fencing around moving parts.<div style="line-height:9px"><br></div>
		Hazards can change from day to day, so carry out inspections regularly.
        <div style="line-height:12px"><br></div>
      <b>Assessing Risks</b>
<div style="line-height:6px"><br></div>
To carry out a basic risk assessment follow these four steps:<div style="line-height:3px"><br></div>
1. Gather information about each hazard that you identify.<br>
2. Work out the likelihood of an accident or incident occurring. Consider how many people are &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;likely
to be exposed to each hazard and for how long.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will need to take into account those different situations/conditions that may exist in your &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;workplace that could increase risk, such as a change to operations, inspection, cleaning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;maintenance, servicing and repairs, new or inexperienced staff.<br>
3. Assess the consequences. Use the information you have gathered to assess the potential &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;l
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consequences of each hazard, for example, people could:<div style="line-height:3px"><br></div>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o die;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o suffer major injuries (with significant long term effects);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o suffer minor injuries (usually requiring several days off work); or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o suffer negligible injuries (maybe needing first aid).<div style="line-height:9px"><br></div>
      <div align="center"><em><strong>If you are accustomed with all issues of workplace inspections <br>
        then 
        get something done with your formative assessment.
      </strong> </em></div>

      <b>Checklists</b> 
      <div style="line-height:6px"><br>
      </div>
The inspection process may be aided by the use of <a href="checklists2a.htm">checklists</a> and, while there is generally no absolute need to use them, they may be worth having in order that necessary checks on items are not missed. However, they have the disadvantage that they may reduce the likelihood not looking for  items that are not on the checklist. If you have a checklist make sure there are reminders that not every item is  on the checklist.
Checklists may contain various types of items according to the type of building sites being inspected and the purpose of the inspection.

      <b>Formative Assessment</b><div style="line-height:6px"><br>
      </div> 
      As a safety inspector you should visit different location at our campus and  find  safety issues that must be dealt with.
In addition you need to  make recommendations for improving the safety issues. Compliance with the OS&amp;H act and regulations are mandatory.
<div style="line-height:4px"><br>
      </div>  
	This formative assessment  facilitate  investigation ability of safety issues and gives direction in preparing inspection reports.  Look for any safety concerns at our college (Courtyard, canteen, class rooms etc) and prepare a <i>'Workplace&nbsp;Inspection&nbsp;Report</i>. <br>
You can download a <i>'Workplace&nbsp;Inspection&nbsp;Report&nbsp;Form'</i> as a <a href="Workplace Inspection Template.doc">word document</a> or  a <a href="Workplace Inspection Template.pdf">acrobat-pdf-file</a>. (If you use the word-doc then you can type the safety concerns in the <i>'Hazard' </i>column  <font size="2">(two lines of text  can be written in each row)</font> but if you can't fit all the issues in a row then increase the row height). List the locations that you'll investigate  onto the from. The two columns <i>'Hazard'</i> and <i>'Recommended Corrective Action'</i>	need also to be filled in and leave the columns <i>'Designated Contact to Complete</i>' free.
      <div style="line-height:3px"><br></div>
     
      You may need to contact  Nicky or  Fiona  if you  want access to class rooms.
<div style="line-height:3px"><br>
      </div> 
      Please note:
Most builders are not inclined to give students access to building sites to make notices on safety issues especially if they mention something about safety inspection reporting

	  <b>Quizzes</b><div style="line-height:4px"><br>
      </div>  
      There are quizzes which you should attempt. They make you familiar with the safety legislation and prepare your for  assessment quizzes.
