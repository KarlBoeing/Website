      <b><font size="4">Workplace Inspections</font></b> <div style="line-height:6px"><br></div>
 
An effective inspection program is one of the most important preventative measures that a company can take to ensure a safe and healthy workplace.
<div style="line-height:4px"><br></div>
     
     Regular workplace inspections must be performed to ensure that a safe working environment is maintained throughout the workplace. Such inspections aim to identify any systematically occurring hazards in the workplace and to ensure that safety practices are maintained throughout the Construction site.   
     <div style="line-height:4px"><br></div>
     
    Usually checklist are been developed to check certain safety issues on the site. 
The checklist is a tool to assist in the identification of workplace hazards. 
The checklist can be modified to meet the specific needs of the workplace.
<div style="line-height:4px"><br></div>
A checklist:<div style="line-height:2px"><br></div>
<div style="text-indent:40px"><li>Provides a structured and documented approach to identifying and controlling hazards.
<li>Provides a basic and consistent approach for workplace inspection and hazard identification.</li></div>
     <div style="line-height:4px"><br></div>
     A short walk-through the construction site to look for any hazards should be carried out at least
fortnightly or monthly – this may not be sufficient to identify all hazards in your workplace.
      <div style="line-height:6px"><br></div>
        Some items you may include in your inspections are:<div style="line-height:3px"><br></div>
        o Housekeeping - floors, work benches, ladders, walkways.<br>
        o First aid and amenities - first aid equipment, supply of drinking water, suitable washrooms and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;toilets.<br>
        o Fire and emergency safety - access and exits, firefighting equipment, alarm systems.<br>
        o Plant and equipment - cutting, crushing, or trapping hazards and unsafe conditions due to things &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like pressurised contents, flying particles, noise, hot or cold parts.<br>
        o Chemical hazards - personal protective equipment, ventilation, labels, containers, storage, signs,  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and material safety data sheets.<br>
        o Electrical - residual current devices (RCDs), the condition and location of cables, plugs, sockets  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and switches, tag/lock out.<br>
        o Ergonomic and manual handling - the design of work stations, height of bench tops and desks, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seating, tasks involving lifting, carrying, reaching, stretching and repetition.<br>
        o Machinery guarding - barriers, fencing around moving parts.</p>
      <div style="line-height:9px"><br></div>
		Hazards can change from day to day, so carry out inspections regularly.
        <div style="line-height:6px"><br></div>
      To identify safety and health hazards, work  through the following actions:
   <br>
   1. Organise "walk through" inspections of your workplace.<br>
   2. List all the tasks/work activities carried out.<br>
   3. Look at the ways in which different tasks/work activities may interact to cause a hazard.
   <br>
   4. Write down all the hazards you can identify. <br>
   5. Look at past incidents or injuries in your workplace. <br>
   6. Look at any information provided by manufacturers or suppliers, eg on particular items of plant,
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;equipment or chemicals.<br>
   7. Talk to other workplaces in a similar line of business.
   <br>
   8. Refer to the  OS&amp;H-Regulations and various Codes of Practice. 
        <div style="line-height:12px"><br></div>
      <b>Assessing Risks</b>
<div style="line-height:6px"><br></div>
To carry out a basic risk assessment follow these four steps:<div style="line-height:3px"><br></div>
1. Gather information about each hazard that you identify.<br>
2. Work out the likelihood of an accident or incident occurring. Consider how many people are &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;likely
to be exposed to each hazard and for how long.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will need to take into account those different situations/conditions that may exist in your &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;workplace that could increase risk, such as a change to operations, inspection, cleaning,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;maintenance, servicing and repairs, new or inexperienced staff.<br>
3. Assess the consequences. Use the information you have gathered to assess the potential &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;l
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consequences of each hazard, for example, people could:<div style="line-height:3px"><br></div>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o die;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o suffer major injuries (with significant long term effects);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o suffer minor injuries (usually requiring several days off work); or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o suffer negligible injuries (maybe needing first aid).<div style="line-height:9px"><br></div>
      4. Rate the risk. 
      <div style="line-height:6px"><br></div>Use the Risk Rating Table below to work out the risk associated with each hazard.<div style="line-height:9px"><br></div>

		 <div align="center">  <img src="RiskRatingTable400.jpg" width="400" height="285"></div><div style="line-height:12px"><br></div>
      <font size="4"><b>Risk Control</b></font><div style="line-height:9px"><br></div>
 Take action to control the risks you have assessed, starting with those having the highest risk rating. In deciding what controls to put in place, begin by trying to remove the hazard completely. If that is not practicable, work down through the options as explained below. 
      <div style="line-height:9px"><br>
      </div>
        
      <b>Level 1</b> - Eliminate the hazard 
      <div style="line-height:3px"><br></div>
        For example, if a solvent, that is a hazardous substance, has been used to remove oil from parts coming out of a press, remove the oil and you will eliminate the need for solvents. <div style="line-height:9px"><br></div>
        <b>Level 2</b> - Minimise the risk of the hazard<br>
      <div style="line-height:3px"><br></div>
        Examples and ways to do this may be:<br><div style="line-height:3px"><br></div>
        o Substitution - use a non-flammable solvent in place of a flammable one.<br>
        o Modification - fit roll-over protection and seat belts to a tractor.<br>
        o Isolation - remove a noisy machine to a dedicated room.<br>
        o Engineering controls - install cut-out switches, screens and guards.<div style="line-height:9px"><br></div>
        
      <b>Level 3</b> - Ensure safe work practices and supply personal protective equipment if needed. 
      <div style="line-height:3px"><br></div>
        
     Examples and ways to do this may be to provide training on the hazard/risk, introduce tag out/lock out procedures, and provide personal protective equipment/clothing (PPE). PPE should always be the last option.

   <b>Safety Officer:</b> <div style="line-height:3px"><br></div> 
He or she may be appointed by a builder and is responsible for monitoring and assessing safety hazards or unsafe situations, and for developing measures for ensuring personnel safety.  <br>
Workplace Health and Safety Officers provide expert advice to employers to help them meet their obligations under the OS&H-Act. 
They are trained to identify health and safety hazards and help implement risk assessments in the workplace.<div style="line-height:9px"><br></div> 
      <b>WorkSafe Inspectors</b>
<div style="line-height:3px"><br></div> 

WorkSafe inspectors are appointed by the Commissioner and trained to enforce the OS&H-Act, assist with the resolution of issues in workplaces and provide advice to employers and employees to how best to improve workplace safety and health performance. 


When WorkSafe inspectors visit your workplace they will use a checklist of common hazards to look for key safety elements. If a builder fails to meet safety standards, inspectors will issue the builder with verbal instructions, an improvement notice, a prohibition notice or any combination of
these.
It's also their duty to investigate employee complaints regarding their workplace, to advise workers and employers on safety in the workplace, and to ensure that safety and health rules are adhered to.
