      <font size="4"><b>Risk Control</b></font><div style="line-height:9px"><br></div>
 Take action to control the risks you have assessed, starting with those having the highest risk rating. In deciding what controls to put in place, begin by trying to remove the hazard completely. If that is not practicable, work down through the options as explained below. 
      <div style="line-height:9px"><br>
      </div>
        
      <b>Level 1</b> - Eliminate the hazard 
      <div style="line-height:3px"><br></div>
        For example, if a solvent, that is a hazardous substance, has been used to remove oil from parts coming out of a press, remove the oil and you will eliminate the need for solvents. <div style="line-height:9px"><br></div>
        <b>Level 2</b> - Minimise the risk of the hazard<br>
      <div style="line-height:3px"><br></div>
        Examples and ways to do this may be:<br><div style="line-height:3px"><br></div>
        o Substitution - use a non-flammable solvent in place of a flammable one.<br>
        o Modification - fit roll-over protection and seat belts to a tractor.<br>
        o Isolation - remove a noisy machine to a dedicated room.<br>
        o Engineering controls - install cut-out switches, screens and guards.<div style="line-height:9px"><br></div>
        
      <b>Level 3</b> - Ensure safe work practices and supply personal protective equipment if needed. 
      <div style="line-height:3px"><br></div>
        
     Examples and ways to do this may be to provide training on the hazard/risk, introduce tag out/lock out procedures, and provide personal protective equipment/clothing (PPE). PPE should always be the last option.

 <p>Control measures vary in their effectiveness (i.e. of minimising exposure to safety or health hazards). Those methods that are potentially the most effective are placed at the top of a preferred hierarchy of control options and used first, where practicable, in designing the hazard control system.
 The <a href="Hierarchy of control.htm">Hierarchy of Controls</a> is the preferred order of control measures for all OHS risks.   </p>
