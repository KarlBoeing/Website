      <div style="line-height:3px"><br>
      </div>
      The aim of the site inspection (<i>Formative Assessment 1</i>) is to identify risks that exists on  building site and to make suggestions  how these risks can be controlled.  

<div style="line-height:3px"><br>
      </div>
  
        Apart from the site visit    a Job Safety Analysis (JSA)   (<i>Formative Assessment 2</i>)   needs to be prepared to provide a safe working environment
for employees, subcontractors  and visitors.  Appropriate strategies should be introduced to make sure all people working in the area are not subjected to any work-related    injuries. 
        <div style="line-height:6px"><br>   </div>
          Further   recommendations for improving the safety and compliance with the OS&amp;H act and regulations may be required.
        
       
        Recommendations should be provided to address areas of concern.

        <b>Consultation process</b>
        <div style="line-height:6px"><br>
      </div>
        By law, employers must consult with employees on a range of matters that
directly affect (or are likely to directly affect) their health and safety, so far
as is reasonably practicable.
        <div style="line-height:3px"><br>
      </div>
        Consultation must involve sharing information with employees, giving the employees
a reasonable opportunity to express their views and taking those views into account.
Under the duty, employers must consult with their employees to enable the
employees to contribute to the making of decisions affecting their health, safety
and welfare at work.
        <div style="line-height:3px"><br>
      </div>
        Consultation must be undertaken by one or a combination of the following means:
        <div style="line-height:3px"><br>
      </div>
        a) The establishment of one or more Committees;
<br>
      b) The election of one or more  OS&H Representatives;
<br>
      c) Other arrangements agreed by the employer and employees .<br>
        <div style="line-height:9px"><br>
      </div>
        Employers should give further thought to additional circumstances where consultation
could improve OS&amp;H outcomes.
        <div style="line-height:9px"><br>
      </div>
        Consider how you can ensure effective & meaningful
consultation. One should provide employees with
information to enable them to come to an informed view.  
Decide on the most appropriate and effective
consultation arrangement.
        <div style="line-height:3px"><br>
      </div>
        • To set up an OS&amp;H Committee(s). <br>
• To set up an OS&amp;H Representative(s). <br>
• To set up Other Agreed Arrangements.
        <div style="line-height:6px"><br>
      </div>
        Consultation can be done well and therefore assist in the making of better decisions
about OS&amp;H or it can be done poorly.

success. Employees should be encouraged to:<br>

        Consultation with workers and others who may be affected by the risks in the workplace is essential at all stages of the risk management process. Workers and others may be able to suggest ways to effectively manage the risks and allow them to operate efficiently in their jobs

        <b>Purpose of Control Measures</b>
        <div style="line-height:6px"><br>
      </div>
        In the context of major hazards the purpose of the risk control measures is to eliminate or reduce risk so far as is reasonably practicable. This is achieved, if practicable, by:
        <div style="line-height:3px"><br>
      </div>
   
    
<ul>
      <li>elimination of hazards;</li>
      <li>prevention of hazards leading to major incidents;</li>
      <li>reduction of the magnitude of any major incidents that may occur; and</li>
      <li>mitigation of the severity of consequences of those major incidents.</li>
      <p><b>Risk control measures must be adopted that eliminate or reduce risks to health, safety and property so far as is reasonably practicable.</b>  
        
  
        
      <li>Risk control measures must be adopted for each potential major incident</li>
      <li>Risk control measures must be adopted for each major incident hazard</li>
      <li>The adopted risk control measures must take into account the likelihood of the hazard or risk concerned eventuating </li>
      <li>The adopted risk control measures must take into account the degree of harm that would result if the hazard or risk eventuated.</li>
      <li>The adopted risk control measures must take into account what the person concerned knows, or ought reasonably to know, about the hazard or risk and any ways of eliminating or reducing the hazard or risk</li>
      .
		 
      <li>The adopted control measures must take into account the suitability and availability of risk control measures</li>
      <li>The adopted control measures must take into account the cost of the risk control measures</li>
      <li>Are any known deficiencies in risk control measures being progressively addressed?</li>
      <li>Safety & reliability must be incorporated in design, construction, operation and maintenance of the facility.</li>
      <li>Risk control measures should be at least consistent with industry practice, and with codes and standards.</li>

      <b>Monitor and Review</b>
      <div style="line-height:6px"><br>
      </div>
      Once hazards have been identified and controls put in place a process of evaluation needs to be implemented to assess the on-going effectiveness of the control measure and to determine if the control measures introduced any new hazards. This is done by evaluating the risk after a specified period of time.
      <div style="line-height:3px"><br>
      </div>
      A risk management program is ongoing. The process only begins when current workplace hazards have been identified and does not end when they are successfully controlled. A system of monitoring and review must be implemented as a method of checking that the controls put in place are achieving the desired outcome. 
      <div style="line-height:3px"><br>
      </div>
      Building and construction workplaces are a fluid environment with constant changes which must be reflected in the risk assessments. The opportunity for new hazards to occur in the workplace always exists because of new technology, equipment or products, work practices or procedures, or a change in the work environment including new management and staff. 
      <div style="line-height:3px"><br>
      </div>
      For risk management to be an effective program, hazards associated with changes need to be identified, assessed and eliminated or controlled.

	<b>  Contingency and Emergency Plans</b>  <div style="line-height:6px"><br>

In an emergency, a fast and effective response is critical.  A person's ability to face and handle the situation will depend largely on the amount of training undertaken.
  <div style="line-height:3px"><br>
      </div>
Procedures and specific training for dealing with emergencies will differ in each workplace.  So every worker must become familiar with the plans and procedures developed and practise them in their workplace.
