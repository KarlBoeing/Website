<h2 align="center">Hierarchy of control measures</h2>

  <p>Safety and Heath legislation generally requires a hierarchy of control options to be used as shown in the table below.</p>

  <p>These controls include, from the most extensive to the least: 
<ul>
<li>Modifying the design of the workplace.  </li>
<li>Job rotation or prevention of repeat exposure to known hazards (e.g. exposure to noise for prolonged period,  etc.)  </li>
<li>Substitution. For example, the use of less hazardous chemical materials. </li>
<li>Engineering controls. This may include enclosing or isolating hazards,  etc. </li>
<li>Administration. Reconsider the way that work is conducted and organised. </li>
<li>Training. Staff may need to be made aware of more appropriate work policies and procedures. </li>
<li>Provision of protective equipment. Personal protective equipment is the least expensive option but not always the most effective. Provision of protective equipment is most effective when used in conjunction with other control methods. 
</li></ul>
