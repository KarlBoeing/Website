      <h2 align="center">Job Safety Analysis</h2>
	   A JSA is a safety tool. It helps people  to logically examine a particular job or task so tha t all the hazards (and potential accedents) associated with that job can be identified and assessed. If necessary suitable <a href="Hirachy%20of%20control.htm">control measures</a> may be determined.
<div style="line-height:3px"><br></div>
        Job Safety Analysis (JSA) simply means looking at the work task and considering what is the safest way to complete it. It is a way of becoming aware of the hazards involved in doing the job and taking action to prevent an injury. <div style="line-height:3px"><br></div>
        The JSA process is suitable for different trades do different tasks, and need not require enormous amounts of time or use endless pieces of paper.
        <div style="line-height:3px"><br></div>
        Many tasks undertaken are done routinely and have probably been done the same way for years - sometimes safely, sometimes not. Before starting a task, it is essential to think of what is the safest and best way to do it. These JSA worksheets help in assessing the risks of doing the job.<br>

</div>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <lo>
          	Document the activity: Assemble those involved in the activity and then, using the JSA worksheet, write down the tasks that make up the activity, step by step. 
        </li>
      
        <li>
          <lo>
          Identify the hazards: Next to each task, identify what part of the task may cause injury to those doing the work or to anyone else nearby. </li>
      
        <li>
          <lo>
          	Document the control measures: For each identified hazard, list the measures that need to be put in place to eliminate or minimise any likely risk of injury to those involved. </li>
    
        <li>
          <lo>
        Identify who is responsible: Document the name of the person responsible for implementing the control measure. </li>
    
   
        <li>
          <lo>
          	Monitor and review: Make sure the activity is supervised to ensure the documented process is being followed. The JSA should be reviewed whenever a documented activity changes, when there is a change of personnel or after an appropriate length of time. </li>
      </ol>
      <div style="line-height:12px"><br></div>
      <b>Remember </b>
<div style="line-height:6px"><br></div>
<li>The JSA provides a written record of the process to be used to proceed on a task. As it <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a record that can be used in court, it should be signed off by the parties who have<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;responsibility for the tasks. 
      <li>	The JSA is only a written record. Management processes must be in place to ensure <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;workers have the skills to complete the job and that there is a required level of <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;supervision to ensure the tasks are completed as documented. 
Â·
      <li>The JSA should be completed by all employees involved in the activity, not just the <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;principal contractor or supervisor. 
           <hr>
       Element 3 has a formative "Job Safety Analysis" assessment.
                   To become familiar with a JSA  students should discuss  hazards that are  associated with the jobs shown in the <a href="JSA-Exercise.html" target="_blank">exercise</a> and produce a JSA.
<hr> As soon as you have completed the exercises you should then prepare a Job Safety Analysis assessment. <br>
