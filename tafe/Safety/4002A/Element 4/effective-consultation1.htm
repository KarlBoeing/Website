  <h2>Consultation</h2></div>

Consultation needs to be a two-way exchange between employers and employees that involves:
<div style="line-height:3px"><br></div>
<li> sharing information about health and safety <br>
<li> giving employees a reasonable opportunity to express their views, and <br>
<li> taking those views into account.  <div style="line-height:6px"><br></div>
Employees can be consulted in a variety of ways, including by setting up a health and safety committee or by holding regular meetings.

If employees have elected a health and safety representative (HSR), the HSR must be involved in consultation.
<div style="line-height:3px"><br></div>
By drawing on employees’ knowledge and experience, better decisions can be made about health and safety – and that means fewer workplace injuries.

Through talking about safety, employers can become more aware of hazards in the workplace and employees can provide suggestions about how the work could be done safely.
<div style"line-height:6px"><br></div>
Effective consultation can also lead to:
<div style="line-height:3px"><br></div>
      <li> more informed management decisions that take into account a wider range of ideas &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about health and safety issues in the workplace and how to fix them 
<li> stronger commitment to decisions because everyone’s involved in reaching them 
<li> a tried and tested way of dealing with health and safety problems 
      <li>more openness, respect and trust because employers and employees have a better &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;understanding of each other’s points of view. 
<div style="line-height:3px"><br></div>
        Consultation should not be seen as just a legal requirement, but as an essential part of managing health and safety at work.
<div style="line-height:3px"><br></div>
        According to  the OSH Act Part IV - Safety and health represetatives and committies  (section 30)  employers need  to consult  on matters relevant to election  delegate(s) of the  employees on issues that will  directly, affect their safety, health or welfare.
      <div style="line-height:3px"><br></div>
        Employees are represented by  safety and  health representative (SHR).
<div style="line-height:12px"><br></div>
        WorkSafe has a range of guidance materials to advise on the required processes and actions that duty-holders must take in order to meet their legal obligations. 
<div style="line-height:3px"><br></div>
        This is not only a legal responsibility - there are very real benefits for an employer to implement and maintain a consultative approach. It ensures that a safe and healthy work environment, and work practices, programs and procedures are actually created and maintained by the people who must work within these systems and be guided by them. 
<div style="line-height:3px"><br></div>
        Workplace consultation explained simply 
<div style="line-height:3px"><br></div>
        Effective consultation means:
<div style="line-height:3px"><br></div>
        • that consultation takes place before the agenda is set and decisions are made <br>

• the employer is facilitative and listens <br>

• employees are pro-active, and are encouraged to suggest ideas <br>

• training is provided for employees in risk assessment, and in communication skills <br>

• that communication is interactive, genuine and collaborative <br>

• people work together with trust and mutual respect <br>

• the business is open and receptive to employee participation <br>

• information which is relevant is provided <br>

• there are opportunities for one-to-one communication with employees and there is <br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clear, ongoing feedback <br>

• outcomes of the consultation process result in improvements to the systems for managing safety in the workplace <br>
