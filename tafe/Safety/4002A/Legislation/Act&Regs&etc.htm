      <div style="line-height:12px"><br></div>
      <p><font size="3">It is  essential that you become familiar with the Occupational Safety and Health Act</font>. Unfortunately links to specific sections of the Act cannot be made. There are some links in a contents page but you should download the Act as a pdf-doc from the <a href="http://www.slp.wa.gov.au/legislation/statutes.nsf/main_mrtitle_650_homepage.html">State Law Publisher</a> site. In this case you will always have a current edition of the Act.

      If you have downloaded the Act  then click on the bookmark icon as shown in the opposite figure.<br>
<div style="line-height:12px"><br></div>
      <img src="pdf-doc-html.jpg" width="130" height="66" align="left">
       (you can also download the Act as a pdf-file, MS-word or a html-file).
      <p><img src="pdf-bookmarks.jpg" width="300" height="327" align="left">However, the most appropriate download is using  a <b>pdf-file</b>. <br>
     If you click on the bookmark icon then it will expand and you'll see the contents of all parts, divisions, and section as shown in the opposite figure. If you  click on on any section, then  that specific section of the Act will be shown.<br>

        Please use the slider bar to scroll up or down.<div style="line-height:6px"><br></div>
     There is no need to buy the Act or  the Regulations because it's easy to download it from the Internet and then access the necessary  information.
      <div style="line-height:12px"><br></div>
  The same principle as outlined above applies for the <b>Occupational Safety and Health Regulations</b>.
<div style="line-height:12px"><br></div>
<table  width="320" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6">
  <tr>
          <td bgcolor="#ffffff">
            <div align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There are  quizzes that will test your knowledge  of the Act and Regulations.</font></div>
          </td>
  </tr>
</table>
      <div style="line-height:12px"><br></div> 
      For  the quizzes   you need the OS&amp;H Act and OS&amp;H Regulations open on your screen if you don't have a hard copy at hand.   
      <div style="line-height:6px"><br></div> 
      However, before you access a quiz make sure  the Act and Regulation are open on your screen.  <div style="line-height:6px"><br></div> 
      If you open a quiz you <b>must</b> finish the quiz otherwise you'll not be able to open or reopen the quiz. Quizzes must be completed in a given time and if you don't submit  the quiz the time is still running. That's the reason while a quiz can't be open because it's still waiting for input. So make sure  quizzes are finished and  submitted as it should be.
