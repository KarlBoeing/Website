This page helps you to access the relevant information on Occupational Safety and Health legislation.<div style="line-height:12px"><br> </div> 
First of all you need to study the makeup of the Act and Regulations in greater detail before you attempt quizzes. The quizzes will ask you specific questions about the OS&H Act and Regulations and you will not be able to answer questions if you do not know the nitty gritty of the Act & Regulations. Please study the contents of the Act as well as the Regulations (click the links <font color="blue">contents page</font> below). It will be of great benefit if you would make a copy of the contents pages. In more than one cases you may answer quiz questions with the information provided in the contents pages. If this is not possible search for the specific section of the Act or Regulations.

      <p>The Act provides a framework where consultation, cooperation, regulations, 
        codes of practice, workplace standards and procedures to resolve issues 
        support the general duty of care. The general duty of care is the guiding 
        principle for all other parts of the Act.      <div style="line-height:9px"><br></div>
     The <b>Occupational Safety and Health Act</b> sets objectives to promote 
        and improve occupational safety and health standards. The Act sets out 
        broad duties and is supported by more detailed requirements in the <b>Occupational 
        Safety and Health Regulations</b>. The legislation is further supported 
        by guidance material such as approved Codes of Practice. This legislative 
        framework is depicted below.   <div style="line-height:6px"><br></div>
      <img src="inter.gif" width="386" height="491" align="left"><br>
        <br><br>
        The Act is a State legislation and all other Australian States have similar legislation.
      <br>       <div style="line-height:35px"><br></div>
      <br>
      
      
      The Occupational Safety and Health Regulations, made under the Act, describe 
        some of the requirements, which apply to specific work situations.<br>
         Not complying with the regulation may result in a penalty payment.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
      <br><br>
      
      Code of  &nbsp;Practice and  Guidance Notes  themselves are not legally binding but they provide you with specific and detailed information that is not covered  in the regulations.

  It is  essential that you become familiar with the Occupational Safety and Health Act. Unfortunately direct links to specific sections of the Act cannot be made. If you have not a hard copy then  you may download the <a href="http://www.slp.wa.gov.au/legislation/statutes.nsf/main_mrtitle_650_homepage.html">OS&H Act</a> as a pdf-doc from the State Law Publisher site. In this case you will always have a current edition of the Act.

 How to answer 
      quizzes and assessments</font></h3></a>
     

      All quizz questions and assessment questions have one 
        or two answer boxes. Most important is how you type your answers in the 
        boxes. Refer to a typical question below for a correct input into the 
        boxes: </font>
 <div style="line-height:6px"><br></div><img src="quizz.gif" align="left">
   In the first box a choice of 
        <b>a, b, c,</b> or <b>d</b> must be entered. This can be done in <b>lower</b> 
        or <b>upper</b> case. </font> 
  <div style="line-height:6px"><br></div>
In the second box a <b>Regulation</b> 
        or an <b>Act</b> number must be entered.<br>
        Example - <b>r3.112</b> or <b>a57</b> (R3.112 or A56 is also acceptable)<br>
     <div style="line-height:6px"><br></div>    
        Note: - <b>No space</b> between letter and numbers! 
      <div style="line-height:6px"><br></div> 
        Do not forget to <b>save</b> your answer! You can modify the answer later 
        if you wish but do save your answer again.
	      <div style="line-height:6px"><br></div>	
        The <b>correct</b> input of your answers is very important. A failure 
        to do so will mark your answer wrong although it could be right.
		</font>
 <div style="line-height:6px"><br></div>
    Don't attempt a quiz if you 
        aren't prepared for it. Make sure you allowed    sufficient time  for completion of the quiz 
    before you start the quiz.</font>     
		<div style="line-height:6px"><br></div>
You can access each quiz four 
        (5) times. A certain time limit is set to answer a quiz. Watch the <font color="#339933">Time 
        remaining </font>in the upper right corner. Make sure you click the "<b>Finish</b>" button 
        otherwise you won't be able to access the quiz again. Note your results 
        &amp; time and compare this with your next attempt. Your next attempt 
    should give you a higher score and a better time.</font><br>
