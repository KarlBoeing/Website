      <p>The unit <span class="style3">(BSBOHS504B)</span> applies to individuals with managerial responsibility for providing a systematic approach to hazard identification, risk assessment and risk control, with the emphasis on elimination or, where this is not possible, minimisation of risk. It also includes conceptual models for understanding the nature of hazards. <a href="http://www.commerce.wa.gov.au/WorkSafe/">WorkSafe</a> with the <a href="http://www.docep.wa.gov.au/WorkSafe/Content/Services/ThinkSafe/Thinksafe%20index.htm">ThinkSafe Small Business Program</a> has been developed using the best small business workplace safety programs and has helped over 3000 small businesses around Western Australia improve safety in their workplace.</p>
   
     
  
 <p>A systematic approach</p>
   
<p>A safe workplace doesn&rsquo;t happen by chance or guesswork. It requires a systematic approach to finding and fixing hazards and risks.
  This approach ensures the highest level of protection is in place for people  at work. Element 1 begins with familiarisation of accessing  sources of information and data to identify hazards.</p> 
 
   <p>   A systematic approach is particularly helpful when there is <STRONG>limited   knowledge</STRONG> about the hazards and how to control the risks in the   particular circumstances.</p>
  

  

  
 <p> <a href="HB205-2004 (1).pdf" target="_blank">Hazards and risk assessment</a> is an important part of a  safety management system. To formulate a safety policy  one  should investigate the <strong>injury statistics</strong> to identify hazards that may occurs in the work place</p>
  <p>
    Injury and disease statistics should then be used for risk assessments. Statistical data should include:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.commerce.wa.gov.au/WorkSafe/PDF/Statistics-industry/industry_benchmarks.pdf">Lost time injuries:</a> <em>these are work injuries that result in a person being away from work. LTI's are usually reported as a rate against the number of hours worked or the number of workers employed. </em>
      <li>Medical treatment injuries: <em>these are injuries referred to a medical practitioner that do not result in a lost time injury. </em>
      <li>First aid injuries: <em>these are injuries that are treated on site and do not usually result in any lost time.</em>
        </ul>
   <p> Medical treatment injuries and first aid injuries can be used as early indicators for problems that may lead to more serious lost time injury accidents.</p>
   
    There are some problems with injury statistics:
    <ul>
      <li> injury rates often do not reflect the potential severity of an event,<br>
      <li>there is not necessarily a relationship between ‘occupational’ injury statistics and
        control of major accident hazards
      <li> a low injury rate can lead to complacency.
      <li> a low injury rate results in fewer data being available.
      </ul>
    
      <strong>Sources of information</strong>
      <div style="line-height:4px"><br>
      </div>
      Ask yourself where can I obtain these data and sources of information?
 Who do I need to work with? What agencies (industry bodies, union, employer groups, manufacturers etc) can help me to find the necessary data and information?
            <div style="line-height:6px"><br></div>

 If an organisation develops a safety & health policy it will consider  safety  statistics to control safety and health risks. 
  The organization need to recognise that there is no <strong>single</strong> reliable measure of 
  health and safety performance.
