      <hr> 
      There are different models to analyse the safety issues. 
       The conduction of an accident  analysis is important in understanding and effectively managing workplace  safety. It is important to note that the application of different theories and  models may affect the methodologies utilized when undertaking accident  investigations, and indeed the focus of the investigations on different aspects  of the workplace environment and organization.</p>
      Read the WorkSafe resource <a href="Risk_Management Process.pdf" target="_blank">Risk Management Process</a>. 
      The intent of this reading is to provide the student with a structured 
      system for identifying hazards and assessing risks associated with those hazards.
      <div style="line-height:9px"><br>
      </div> 
	  You may start with a Safety<b> inspections</b> as the "First Step"  identifying all the things that could lead to injury or harm to the health of you or your employees, or at worst that could lead to a death occurring in your workplace. It explains some common hazards found in most workplaces, and then shows you how to actually:     
      <div style="line-height:3px"><br>
      </div>
   <div style="text-indent:25px">   <li><b>Spot the hazards </b>(…in your workplace); </div>        
 
      <div style="text-indent:25px"><li><b>Assess the risk</b> (…of injury, harm to health or death occurring); and    </div>  
     
      <div style="text-indent:25px"><li><b>Make changes</b> (…that eliminate or reduce the risk).  </div>   <div style="line-height:6px"><br>
      </div>
 If you have  taken the "First Step", you should consider  how to manage the     
          hazards in your workplace, assist you to improve your performance and 
          help you take the "Next Step". You have to know the hazards to complete the next step  to writing a safety plan.
<div style="line-height:9px"><br>
      </div>
		  Do you know what hazards are in your workplace?   <div style="line-height:3px"><br>
      </div>
<div style="text-indent:25px"><li> List your main work activities.</div>
<div style="text-indent:25px"><li>Break the work activity into basic steps (or tasks). </div>
      <div style="text-indent:25px"><li>Identify and write down the hazards for each work activity. </div>
      <div style="text-indent:25px"><li>Get expert advise from people in your workplace doing  work activities. </div>
      <div style="text-indent:25px">
      <li>Use safety and health information in codes of practice, standards, material safety data  sheets,      </div> 
<div style="text-indent:40px">information from suppliers of plant and other industry sources. </div>
<div style="text-indent:25px"><li>Use information from your records of work-related incidents (including property  damage
</div> <div style="text-indent:40px">and near misses), injuries and diseases.</div>
<div style="text-indent:25px"><li>Carry out inspections of your workplace. </div>

<div style="line-height:12px"><br>
      </div>
      <b><a href="checklists3.htm" target="_blank">Checklists</a></b> 
      <div style="line-height:6px"><br></div>
The inspection process may be aided by the use of checklists and, while there is generally no absolute need to use them, they may be worth having in order that necessary checks on items are not missed. However, they have the disadvantage that they may reduce the likelihood not looking for  items that are not on the checklist. If you have a checklist make sure there are reminders that not every item is  on the checklist.
Checklists may contain various types of items according to the type of building sites to be inspected and the purpose of the inspection. 
      <div style="line-height:12px"><br></div>
	  <b>Categorising hazards </b>  
      <div style="line-height:6px"><br></div>Workplace hazards are not always obvious. Some hazards can result in long-term health effects rather than an immediate injury. For example, exposure to loud noise over a period of time can result in hearing loss; or contact with a solvent can cause dermatitis.
  <div style="line-height:6px"><br></div>
To assist in identifying hazards, they may be categorised as follows:
  <div style="line-height:6px"><br></div>
<div style="text-indent:25px">
        <li><b>The obvious hazard</b> is apparent to the senses (e.g. unguarded machinery, building  </div>
		<div style="text-indent:40px">defects, faulty electrical equipment). </div>
<div style="text-indent:25px">
        <li><b>The concealed hazard</b> is not apparent to the senses (e.g. electricity, presence of toxic vapours,  </div>
		<div style="text-indent:40px">or high frequency noise).      </div>
<div style="text-indent:25px">
        <li><b>The developing hazard </b>cannot be recognised immediately and will develop over time (e.g.     </div><div style="text-indent:40px">a worn tyre on a mobile crane and frayed steel cables). 
      </div>
<div style="text-indent:25px">
        <li><b>The transient hazard</b> is an intermittent or a temporary hazard (e.g. overload of machinery,   </div><div style="text-indent:40px">when a confined space permit has expired, a sticking safety valve on a boiler, intermittent <div style="text-indent:40px">electrical or mechanical defect).       </div> 
      </div>  
		<div style="line-height:6px"><br></div>
It is important to remember that a hazard may become more obvious and easily identifiable when a person actually performs a task. This is often the case with ergonomics or manual tasks.
  <div style="line-height:6px"><br></div>
To make the job of identifying hazards in the workplace easier, prepare and establish the context for the risk management process. This involves identifying: 
  <div style="line-height:6px"><br></div>
<div style="text-indent:25px"><li>all activities involved in work processes and tasks; </div>
<div style="text-indent:25px"><li>who is involved in those activities; and </div>
<div style="text-indent:25px"><li>items of plant or materials that are used. </div>
  <div style="line-height:6px"><br></div>
Then make a list of all the hazards at the workplace.

  <div style="line-height:12px"><br></div>
	  
	  
      <b>Hazard Reports</b>       <div style="line-height:6px"><br> </div>
Effective hazard reporting is essential for successful hazard management and to meet expected outcomes.   
<div style="line-height:6px"><br></div>
      Implementing the use of Hazard Reports  will encourage your staff to identify and report hazards. You can then implement controls before an injury occurs. Encourage staff to complete Hazard Reports for any situation which requires actions beyond simple maintenance. <div style="line-height:6px"><br> </div> Hazard Reports should be:   
      <div style="line-height:3px"><br> </div>
<div style="text-indent:25px"><li>completed by anyone - employees, managers, contractors, volunteers or residents/families </div>
<div style="text-indent:25px"><li>signed by the person who completes them </div> 

<div style="text-indent:25px"><li>investigated, and improvements planned and implemented by the director/supervisor (in<br>
<div style="text-indent:40px">consultation with staff) </div>
      </div> 
<div style="text-indent:25px"><li>signed by a Health and Safety Committee member or employee representative (if there is one)  </div>
<div style="text-indent:25px"><li>discussed at a Health and Safety Committee or staff meeting. </div>       <div style="line-height:9px"><br></div>
After discussion at a meeting, you should include comments on the effectiveness of action taken on the Hazard Report and Hazard Log. Provide feedback to the staff member who reported the hazard.

This element has a formative Workplace Inspection &amp; Hazard Report assessment.	  As a safety inspector you should inspect a building site and identify all unsafe issues that must be dealt with. Students who have no access to a building site can inspect different location at our campus . In addition you need to make   recommendations for improving the safety issues. Compliance with the OS&amp;H   act and regulations are mandatory.
