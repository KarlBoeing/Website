     <div style="line-height:3px"><br></div>
     <em>This formative assessment facilitate investigation ability of safety issues and gives direction in preparing inspection reports. Students who are working should inspect a building site and non working students may look for any safety concerns at our college (Courtyard, canteen, class rooms etc) to prepare a 'Workplace Inspection Report.   <div style="line-height:3px"><br></div>
 You can download a 'Workplace Inspection Report Form' as a<a href="Workplace Inspection Template.doc"> word document </a>or a <a href="Workplace Inspection Template.pdf">acrobat-pdf-file</a>. (If you use the word-doc then you can type the safety concerns in the 'Hazard' column (two lines of text can be written in each row) but if you can't fit all the issues in a row then increase the row height). List the locations that you'll investigate onto the from. The two columns 'Hazard' and 'Recommended Corrective Action' need also to be filled in and leave the columns 'Designated Contact to Complete' free.   
    <div style="line-height:3px"><br></div>
 You should contact Nicky or Fiona when class rooms are free to inspect. Students who have access to a workplace may conduct a workplace inspection instead. they should prepare their own 'Workplace Inspection Report Form' similar to the download form..   </em>

    Hazard identification is the process used to identify all the possible situations in the workplace where people may be exposed to injury, illness or disease. Inspections are a good way to identify hazards and issues specific to your work environment and activities. Regular workplace inspections must be performed to ensure that a safe working environment is maintained throughout the organisation. These inspections aim to identify any systematically occurring hazards in the workplace and to ensure that safety practices are maintained.<div style="line-height:4px"><br></div>
      You can either develop your own inspection checklists covering all work areas and tasks carried out in your business, or you can use a checklists and Hazards, Risks and Controls forms.<br>
         Some items you may include in your inspections are: </p>
       <ul>

      <b>Hazard Reporting</b>
      <div style="line-height:6px"><br></div>
       Some companies have automated electronic scheduled and unscheduled hazard reporting systems to the extent that immediate hazards are alerted to necessary personnel and integrated into the reporting process as shown in Figure 1.

Organisations require that hazards are notified in a manner which enables them to be efficiently and effectively actioned. The notification procedure reflects the need to protect the health and safety of staff, workers and visitors. It ensures that hazards are quickly identified and immediately rectified. Managers and/ or Supervisors are responsible for the provision of Hazard Report Forms at each work area. Copies can also be accessed from the OHS web-sites. 


        
        
       <div style="line-height:12px"><br></div>  
      <em>When you finish the workplace inspections all serious hazards identified should be reported. However, if an identified hazard can be corrected immediately, eg moving an extension lead, then that does not require reporting.     
      <div style="line-height:6px"><br></div>
      Please complete the Hazard Report Form and submit it with your Inspection Report. You can download a form as a <a href="StudentReporting.doc">word document</a> or as a <a href="StudentReporting.pdf">pdf-document</a> or design your own form..       </em>

  <font size="4"><strong>Duties of safety officers and WorkSafe inspectors </strong></font>
  <div style="line-height:6px"><br></div> 
   <b>Safety Officer:</b>  
He or she may be appointed by a builder and is responsible for monitoring and assessing safety hazards or unsafe situations, and for developing measures for ensuring personnel safety.  <br>
Workplace Health and Safety Officers provide expert advice to employers to help them meet their obligations under the OS&H-Act. 
They are trained to identify health and safety hazards and help implement risk assessments in the workplace.<div style="line-height:9px"><br></div> 
      <b>WorkSafe Inspectors</b>
<div style="line-height:3px"><br></div> 

WorkSafe inspectors are appointed by the Commissioner and trained to enforce the OS&H-Act, assist with the resolution of issues in workplaces and provide advice to employers and employees to how best to improve workplace safety and health performance. 


When WorkSafe inspectors visit your workplace they will use a checklist of common hazards to look for key safety elements. If a builder fails to meet safety standards, inspectors will issue the builder with verbal instructions, an improvement notice, a prohibition notice or any combination of
these.
It's also their duty to investigate employee complaints regarding their workplace, to advise workers and employers on safety in the workplace, and to ensure that safety and health rules are adhered to.
