      After an accident or dangerous incident, an investigation is vital and
every detail counts. It provides valuable information that can assist
in determining what happened and the actions required to prevent a
similar incident in the future.
      <div style="line-height:6px"><br> </div>
One of the duties of SHRs is to participate in investigations.
However, investigations should be carried out by a team so
everyone can contribute their skills and expertise.<div style="line-height:6px"><br> </div>
A common practice in an accident/incident investigation is to look
for the cause, however this can be restrictive as it focuses attention
on only one, or at best a very few, of the risk factors. Others, that
may be more easily controlled, pass unnoticed.<div style="line-height:6px"><br> </div>
SHRs and their employers need to investigate accidents or
incidents. There are publications that  provides information on how to conduct
an investigation and what to look for during the investigation. Here are some points:
<div style="line-height:3px"><br> </div>
<div style="text-indent:25px"><li>events leading up to the accident;</div>
<div style="text-indent:25px"><li>facts of the incident itself;</div>
<div style="text-indent:25px"><li>acts regarding what occurred immediately after the incident; and</div>
<div style="text-indent:25px"><li>essential factors and causes.</div>

      <b>How to assess the risks in your workplace</b>
<div style="line-height:6px"><br></div>
Don’t overcomplicate the process. In many organisations, the risks are well known
and the necessary control measures are easy to apply. You probably already know
whether, for example, you have employees who move heavy loads and so could
harm their backs, or where people are most likely to slip or trip. If so, check that
you have taken reasonable precautions to avoid injury.<div style="line-height:3px"><br></div>
If you run a small organisation and you are confident you understand what’s
involved, you can do the assessment yourself. You don’t have to be a health and
safety expert.<div style="line-height:3px"><br></div>
If you work in a larger organisation, you could ask a health and safety advisor to
help you. If you are not confident, get help from someone who is competent. In all
cases, you should make sure that you involve your staff or their representatives in
the process. They will have useful information about how the work is done that will
make your assessment of the risk more thorough and effective. But remember, you
are responsible for seeing that the assessment is carried out properly.<div style="line-height:6px"><br></div>
When thinking about your risk assessment, remember:<div style="line-height:3px"><br></div>
<div style="text-indent:25px">
        <li> a hazard is anything that may cause harm, such as chemicals, electricity,
working from ladders, an <br></div>
        <div style="text-indent:40px">       open drawer etc</div>
      <div style="line-height:3px"><br></div>
<div style="text-indent:25px">        <li> the risk is the chance, high or low, that somebody could be harmed by these
and other hazards,<br></div>
     <div style="text-indent:40px">          together with an indication of how serious the harm could
be.      </div>
<div style="line-height:9px"><br></div>
      <b>a) 
&nbsp;Identify the hazards</b>
<div style="line-height:3px"><br></div>First you need to work out how people could be harmed. When you work in a
place every day it is easy to overlook some hazards, so here are some tips to help
you identify the ones that matter:
<div style="line-height:3px"><br></div>
<div style="text-indent:25px"><li>Walk around your workplace and look at what could reasonably be expected
to cause harm.</div>
<div style="line-height:3px"><br></div> 
    <div style="text-indent:25px">  
        <li>Ask your employees or their representatives what they think. They may have
noticed things that are <br>  </div>   
    <div style="text-indent:40px">        not immediately obvious to you.      </div>
<div style="line-height:3px"><br></div> 
      <div style="text-indent:25px">  
        <li>If you are a member of a trade association, contact them. Many produce very
helpful <br></div>
    <div style="text-indent:40px">        guidance.</div> 
      <div style="line-height:3px"><br></div> 

  <div style="text-indent:25px">      <li> Check manufacturers’ instructions or data sheets for chemicals and
equipment as they can be very <br>
   <div style="text-indent:40px">         helpful in spelling out the hazards and putting
them in their true perspective. </div>
          <div style="line-height:3px"><br>
          </div>
  <div style="text-indent:25px">      <li> Have a look back at your accident and ill-health records – these often help
to identify the less<br> </div>
     <div style="text-indent:40px">          obvious hazards.</div>
      <div style="line-height:3px"><br></div>
<div style="text-indent:25px">
    <div style="text-indent:25px">      <li> Remember to think about long-term hazards to health (eg high levels of
noise or exposure to<br></div>
    <div style="text-indent:40px">          harmful substances) as well as safety hazards.</div>
      </div>
 
<div style="line-height:3px"><br></div>
 
        <div style="line-height:6px"><br>
        </div>
        <b>b)
&nbsp;Decide who might be harmed and how</b>
        <div style="line-height:3px"><br>
        </div>
        For each hazard you need to be clear about who might be harmed; it will help you
identify the best way of managing the risk. That doesn’t mean listing everyone by
name, but rather identifying groups of people (eg ‘people working in the storeroom’
or ‘passers-by’).
        <div style="line-height:3px"><br>
        </div>
        In each case, identify how they might be harmed, ie what type of injury or ill health
might occur. For example, ‘shelf stackers may suffer back injury from repeated
lifting of boxes’.
        <div style="line-height:6px"><br>
        </div>
