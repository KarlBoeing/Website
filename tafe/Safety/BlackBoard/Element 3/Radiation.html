<p class="big style1">What is radiation?
<p>Radiation is energy in motion in the form of waves or streams
of particles. There are many kinds of radiation all around us. Sound
and visible light are familiar forms of radiation. Other types include
ultraviolet radiation, which produces a suntan, infrared radiation,
which is a form of heat energy, and radio and television signals.
When most people hear the word radiation, they often think of
atomic energy, nuclear power, and radioactivity. The energy in this
kind of radiation can cause changes in atoms, creating electrically
charged atoms which we call ions. Radiation which produces ions
is called ionizing radiation.<p class="small">
All life has evolved in an environment filled with ionizing
radiation. However, unlike heat and light, ionizing radiation is invisible
to our senses. You can’t feel, see, hear, taste, or smell it. Before
1895 we didn’t even know it existed. Special instruments, such as
the Geiger counter, allow us to detect and measure ionizing
radiation.</p>
