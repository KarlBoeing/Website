      <h2 align="center">Job Safety Analysis</h2>
	   A JSA is a safety tool. It helps people  to logically examine a particular job or task so tha t all the hazards (and potential accedents) associated with that job can be identified and assessed. If necessary suitable <a href="../Element 4/Hirachy of control.htm" target="_blank">control measures</a> may be determined.
<div style="line-height:3px"><br></div>
        Job Safety Analysis (JSA) simply means looking at the work task and considering what is the safest way to complete it. It is a way of becoming aware of the hazards involved in doing the job and taking action to prevent an injury. <div style="line-height:3px"><br></div>
        The JSA process is suitable for different trades do different tasks, and need not require enormous amounts of time or use endless pieces of paper.<br>
        Job Safety Analysis Worksheets <div style="line-height:3px"><br></div>
        Many tasks undertaken are done routinely and have probably been done the same way for years - sometimes safely, sometimes not. Before starting a task, it is essential to think of what is the safest and best way to do it. These JSA worksheets help in assessing the risks of doing the job.<br>

      <b>Analysis steps:</b><div style="line-height:6px"><br>
</div>
<lo>1.	Document the activity: Assemble those involved in the activity and then, using the JSA worksheet, write down the tasks that make up the activity, step by step. 
      <div style="line-height:3px"><br></div>
<lo>2.	Identify the hazards: Next to each task, identify what part of the task may cause injury to those doing the work or to anyone else nearby. <div style="line-height:3px"><br></div>
<lo>3.	Document the control measures: For each identified hazard, list the measures that need to be put in place to eliminate or minimise any likely risk of injury to those involved. <div style="line-height:3px"><br></div>
<lo>4.	Identify who is responsible: Document the name of the person responsible for implementing the control measure. <div style="line-height:3px"><br></div>
<lo>5.	Monitor and review: Make sure the activity is supervised to ensure the documented process is being followed. The JSA should be reviewed whenever a documented activity changes, when there is a change of personnel or after an appropriate length of time. <div style="line-height:12px"><br></div>
      <b>Remember </b>
<div style="line-height:6px"><br></div>
<li>The JSA provides a written record of the process to be used to proceed on a task. As it <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a record that can be used in court, it should be signed off by the parties who have<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;responsibility for the tasks. 
      <li>	The JSA is only a written record. Management processes must be in place to ensure <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;workers have the skills to complete the job and that there is a required level of <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;supervision to ensure the tasks are completed as documented. 
<li>
The JSA should be completed by all employees involved in the activity, not just the <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;principal contractor or supervisor. 
<div style="line-height:9px"><br></div>

                <hr align="center">
        <div align="left">Element 4 has a formative "<strong><em>Job&nbsp;Safety&nbsp;Analysis</em></strong>" assessment.  
        To become familiar with a JSA  students should discuss  hazards that are  associated with the jobs shown in the <a href="Exercise-1/Exercise-1.html" target="_blank">exercise</a> and produce a JSA. </div><div style="line-height:9px"><br></div>
Then finally prepare a Job Safety Analysis (JSA) similar to the <a href="jobsafetyanalysis-form.pdf" target="_blank">WorkSafe Sample Form</a> for the following activity or task: <br>
        <div style="line-height:6px"> <br>
        </div>
        FORMWORK ERECTION
        <div style="line-height:3px"> <br>
        </div>
        The main hazards when working with formwork are
	    the following: <br>
        <div style="text-indent:15px">
        &bull; Falling from unprotected edges, from bearers,
	    through holes in the formwork deck<br>
        <div style="text-indent:15px">
        &bull; Collapse of the formwork during the concrete
	    pour<br>
        <div style="text-indent:15px">
        &bull; Falling formwork components during stripping
	    of the formwork
        <<div style="text-indent:0">
<div style="line-height:6px"><br> </div>
        The JSA should include: 
	  
	  <blockquote>
 &bull; Reference to the proper design and approval of the formwork by the formwork engineer<br>
  &bull; The installation of suitable signage around the perimeter of the formwork erection zone.<br>
  &bull; Base, supports and ground conditions adequate for the load<br>
  &bull; Props that are plumb, level, securely tied and fitted with the correct pins<br>
  &bull; Safe platform access for installing bearers on H
	      frame U heads from underneath<br>
  &bull; Safe work platforms with guard rails on edges and similar protection of all openings<br>
  • A formwork deck laying method that does not
	      permit walking on bearers<br>
  • Secured ladder access to the formwork deck<br>
  • Inspection by the formwork engineer before
	      allowing concrete pours<br>
  •  Dismantling of the
	      formwork assembly.<br>
	 •    Back propping arrangements
	      and/or re-shoring<br>
• Drop stripping of the formwork must not be
	      permitted<br>
          Note:<br>
	  No person should be permitted to be under the formwork during a
concrete pour.	  </blockquote>
