    <td><h2 align="center">Consultation of workers</h2>

<p>Safety consultation may be an informal or formal process of seeking the views of others before making decisions. Consultation with employees encourages a sense of involvement and participation. People who are consulted about possible changes to work methods, materials and processes are more likely to accept the changes and implement them more effectively.</p>
The objects of the OS&amp;H Act are:
&nbsp;<br>
(a) &nbsp;to promote and secure the safety and health of persons at
work;<br>

(b)&nbsp; to protect persons at work against hazards;<br>

(c)&nbsp; to assist in securing safe and hygienic work
environments;<br>

(d)&nbsp; to reduce, eliminate and control the hazards to which
persons are exposed at work;<br>

<strong>(e)&nbsp; to foster cooperation and consultation between and to
provide for the participation of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;employers and
employees and associations representing employers and
employees in &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the formulation and implementation of<br>
