      <hr>
<h3>A systems model approach</h3>
<p>Here, in this element, continued hazard identification and management of risk control processes are considered through a systems model approach based on standards such as;<br>

- AS/NZS 4801:2001Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems Specification with guidance for use,<br>

- AS/NZS 4360-2004 Risk Management, and<br>

- HB 205-2004 OHS Risk Management Handbook.

<p>The HB 205-2004 OHS Risk Management Handbook list the benefits of structured management of Occupational Safety and Health Risks as;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;	reduced injury and ill health to employees and the community,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;	saving money and adding value by more effective allocation of resources,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;	improved quality of information available to management for decision making,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;	promoting understanding of Occupational Safety and Health risks throughout the organisation,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;	increasing the likelihood of continued business operations and making compliance with OSH <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; legislation easier to demonstrate,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;improving the organisations reputation,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;	ensuring accountability and transparency of decision making,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;	effective strategic planning as a result of increased knowledge & understanding of key risk<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exposures,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;	lower workers compensation costs because undesirable OSH outcomes are foreseen and <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; addressed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;	improved audit processes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;	better outcomes in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and appropriateness of OSH programs <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i.e. programs targeting key risk areas, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;	improved communication both within the organisation and between the organisation and external <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stakeholders.
<p><img src="Fig2-1AS4360-2004-400.jpg" width="400" height="407" align="left"><p>Consider the Risk Management Process as defined by the opposite diagram (Figure 2.1), you will note that Elements 2 & 3 of this course are concerned with Risk Identification, Analysis & Evaluation, and collectively referred to as Risk Assessment.
<p>  Standard AS/NZS 4801:2001,Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems, highlights that â€œthese standards share common management system principles with environmental management systems standards such as AS/NZS ISO 14001:1996, Environmental management system, .... and quality system standards like 
AS/NZS ISO 9001:2000 and encourage the integration of such management system elements. This highlights the occupational safety and health doctrine of integration of an organisations Safety Management System with every facet and operation of the business or organisation. Similarly, standard AS/NZS 4360:2004, Risk Management, is a standard pertaining to all types of risk which an organisation might face - consider the following diagram illustrating various risk categories.
  <p align="center"><img src="Wheel-of-Integration-600.jpg" width="600" height="317"><br>
    <span class="style5">  NSW Dept. of State and Regional Development - Risk Management Guide to Small Business</span>
 <P> It is important to be mindful, when assessing risk, that factors within each of these categories may influence risks posed in another category or categories e.g. Contract & Financial Management and Compliance, OHS & Compliance, Business Planning & Human Resources, and Financial & OHS. 
<P>The Western Australian Occupational Safety and Health Act 1984 is based on a tripartism principle (Government, Employer and Employees) that requires a collaborative approach inclusive of specific provisions for Safety Representatives & Safety Committees, and education. These statutory requirements are also identifiable in the Risk Management Process Model diagram, as is the principle of continuous improvement through monitoring and review (to be discussed in detail in Element 6). 
     <h3>The Risk Management Process</h3>
  <p> An employer  has  moral and legal obligations to provide and maintain a safe and healthy workplace.
  <p>Remember the primary goal of risk management is to eliminate or minimise workplace risk as far as is reasonably practicable.  
  <p> 
    Refer to the above Figure 2.1  Risk Management Process - Overview &nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="style5">(AS/NZS 4360:2004)</span>.

    <span class="style5">HB 205-2004 OHS Risk Management Handbook</span>
    <h3>OHS Risk Register</h3>
 The purposes of a OHS Risk Register is to document all identified and reasonably foreseeable OHS hazards and risks at workplaces. .A generic OHS Risk Registers should be developed for all relevant types of workplaces. The data collected from identifying, assessing and controlling risks is then recorded in the OHS risk register. The register includes the likely impact of risks, causes and risk rating as well as the risk treatment strategies in place to minimise identified risks. The register should be updated regularly. Detailed risk control strategies are detailed in the register for OHS. The risk register is a valuable tool in managing these hazards and support the risk management efforts. 
  <h3>Context, Communication and Consultation</h3>

The ISO Working Group for the Draft revised Risk Management Guide 73 (Guide to Risk Management Standard) defined Risk Management Context as the process of identifying information that may have an influence on the management of risk (goals, objectives, strategies, scope and parameters). 
<p>
Your study of Elements 1 & 2 of this unit, and Western Australian Occupational Safety and Health Act 1984 and Occupational Safety and Health Regulations 1996 provide the basis for considering the context of Occupational Safety and Health Risk.

The context of the risk management process will vary according to the needs of the organisation. It can involve but is not limited to:
<blockquote>

<li>defining responsibilities for the risk management process;<br>

<li>defining the scope, as well as the depth and breadth of risk management activities to <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be carried out including specific inclusions and exclusions;<br>

<li>defining the activity process, function, project, product, service or asset in terms of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time and location as well as its goals and objectives;<br>
<li>defining the relationships between a particular project or activity and other projects or &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;activities of the organisation;<br>
<li>defining the risk assessment methodologies;<br>
<li>defining the way performance is evaluated in the management of risk;<br>
<li>defining and specifying the decisions that have been made; and<br>
<li>identifying, scoping and framing studies needed, their extent and objectives, and the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resources required for such studies.<br>
<i>ISO 31000 Draft Risk Management document</i></blockquote>
<i>External Context</i> is those factors which are outside the organisation yet influence organisational objectives such as market conditions, statutory and contractual compliance. Whilst examples of <i>Internal Context</i> might be organisational structure, capacity, culture, or the risk perceptions of internal stake holders. The later factors of culture and risk perception may be determined, and in some instances influenced, by <i>Communication</i> and <a href="Consultation.html"><i>Consultation</i></a> which will also assist in <i>Risk Assessment</i> and <i>Risk Controls</i> (or Risk Treatment).
<p>
At an operational level, aside from the establishment of a Safety Committee and appointment of Safety representatives, a good way of collaborating with stack holders is through tool box meetings, risk registers and the inclusive development of Safe Methods of Work Statements or JSAs as discussed in Element 2. 
<p>
  <strong>Other elements of the Risk Management Process.</strong>
 <p>With respect to the other elements of the Risk Management Process, the identification, and treatment of risk, or control measures, will be specific to the hazard/s and situations under consideration (and have been discussed at length in preceding Elements of your study). The particular requirements for project and site specific Safety Management and Emergence Preparedness and Response planning are discussed on the following WorkSafe WA <a href="http://www.commerce.wa.gov.au/WorkSafe/Content/Industries/Construction/Further_information/National_standard_for_construction.html#What%20must%20be%20included" target="_blank">web page</a><p>
Developing an effective <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Develop-a-Risk-Management-Plan">Risk Management Plan</a> is an important part of any project, but unfortunately, is often viewed as something that can be dealt with later. Issues often do come up though and without a well developed plan, even small issues can become emergencies.
  <p>The process of Risk Assessment also requires particular consideration as the perception of risk by stakeholders is importance in determining appropriate methodology and conveying findings of evaluation of risks within an organisation. Risk assessment is inherent in human existence. Cognition, perception, motivation and attitude interplay with decision making and prioritizing actions across the spectrum of interests, needs and concerns (Glendon and Mc Kenna 1995).? The difficulty arises when other parties are making, or are perceived to be making, judgements regarding stakeholders exposure to risk, particularly of an occupational safety or health nature, were exercising and demonstrating empathy is of paramount importance.   
  <p>The following extracts from AS/NZS 4360:2004 identify various characteristics and attributes of differing methods of risk analysis.</p>

<p>Open the following link to the <a href="http://www.riskex.com.au/downloads.htm">Electronic Risk Calculator</a> and discuss with your colleagues or fellow students;
<blockquote>
-	the appropriateness of this methodology in various occupational safety and health<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;situations, and<br> 
-	the role that consultation, communication and education might play in each scenario.</blockquote>


 <p class="style6">
(The procedure to calculate risk score electronically follows similar steps as in the manual risk <a href="RiskRatingProgram.html">score nomogram</a> . Risk score nomograms are based on OHS Risk Assessment AS/NZS 4804:2001 and contained in HB205-2004 OHS Risk Management Handbook. The risk assessment calculator is intended as a guide to identify level of risk. The risk score should be interpreted with caution. It should only be used as a basis for reasoned judgment.)
 <p>   The process of <i>Monitoring and Review</i> will be the subject of Element 6.
