    <td><h3>Risk Rating</h3>
      <p>There are many risk management methodologies available. Table 3 (Risk rating) in Element 4 identifies a risk level (low, moderate, high or very high) dependent on the consequence and likelihood.</p>
      <p>Risk score nomograms are used to determine a  risk score from 5 to 500 as shown in Figure 1. An electronic risk score calculator can be use to find a risk score very quickly).</p>
      <p>A nomogram shows the relationship   between three variables ie. consequence, exposure & probability/likelihood. The exact procedure is outlined below.</p>
     <div style="line-height:9px" align="center"><br>
      </div>   
      
          To use a risk score nomogram: 
          <ol>
        <li>Start with the most likely or typical CONSEQUENCES resulting from exposure to the hazard and mark your choice on the POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES line. </li>
        <li> Estimate the EXPOSURE, that is, how often people, plant and equipment are exposed to the hazard, and mark your estimate on the EXPOSURE line. </li>
        <li> What is the likelihood or chance that the consequences you have predicted will follow?  Mark your choice on the PROBABILITY line. </li>
        <li> Draw a line from the point on the PROBABILITY scale to the appropriate point on the EXPOSURE scale. </li>
        <li>   Extend the line to the TIE LINE. </li>
        <li>    Draw a line from the intersection of the TIE LINE to the appropriate point on the POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES scale.<br />
          </li>
      
        <li>   Extend the line to the RISK SCORE scale.<br />
          </li>
      </ol>

 <strong>CALCULATING THE RISK SCORE</strong><br />
The risk score calculator is intended as a guide to identify level of risk.        
        The electronic risk score calculator allows you to quickly change the risk parameters. As shown in Figure 1 and 2 using the same risk parameters both nomograms display the same risk score (Moderate)

   <div style="line-height:6px"><br>
      </div>   <span class="style3">(The procedure to calculate risk score electronically follows similar steps as in the manual risk score nomogram . Risk score nomograms are based on OHS Risk Assessment AS/NZS 4804:2001 and contained in HB205-2004 OHS Risk Management Handbook. The risk assessment calculator is intended as a guide to identify level of risk. The risk score should be interpreted with caution. It should only be used as a basis for reasoned judgment.)</span>

      <p>You will work with the <a href="http://www.riskex.com.au/downloads.htm">Electronic Risk Calculator</a> in Element 5 by selection risk parameters and find the risk score. </p>
