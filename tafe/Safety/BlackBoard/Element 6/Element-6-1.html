<h3>Monitoring and review of The Risk Management Process.</h3>

To ensure safety and health objectives are met effectively <i>Risk Criteria</i>i>, appropriate methods of measuring these criteria, and the frequency at which these measurements should be taken will be established as part of the consideration of <i>Risk Context</i>. This monitoring of operations and processes should be accompanied periodically by a review of policy and objectives to confirm they are still appropriate and delivering intended outcomes.

<p>
Remember, outcomes AND the management system itself, must be monitored and reviewed against explicit criteria. Risk Criteria are developed at the outset of the Risk Management Process i.e. during consideration of context, as are means to measure these criteria, however both will be continually reconsidered as part of the review process as internal and external context themselves are not static.
<p>Now read the <a href="wsplan_assesssystem.pdf">WorkSafe WA workbook</a>  and consider its proposed audit plan as a tool for review of a Safety and Health Management System.
<p>Once you have completed your reading of the WorkSafe Plan workbook you are ready to attempt <a href="../indicators/AssignmentBrief.htm">Assignment One</a> .
