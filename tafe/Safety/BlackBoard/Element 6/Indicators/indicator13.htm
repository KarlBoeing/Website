      <b>Guidance</b><div style="line-height:6px"><br></div>
Emergency procedures should be relevant to the organisation and the unplanned disruptive incidents that are likely to occur.  They will usually include emergency evacuations from a building or other place such as a construction site, ship, vehicle or a remote location.  The disruptive incidents may include hazardous substance spills, explosions, fire, flood, power failure, bomb threat, robbery, civil protest and vehicle accidents and breakdowns.  There should be a first aid service in all workplaces as part of the management of emergencies, and everyone should understand the procedure to obtain assistance.
<div style="line-height:6px"><br></div>
The organisation should identify the various types of disruptive incidents that may occur, and plan and implement appropriate action. The extent of the type of emergency and the procedures to overcome it should reflect the risks.
<div style="line-height:6px"><br></div>
Emergency management should include action to be taken after a disruptive incident to restore order and provide assistance to employees who may require it.  This is important for people who may suffer long term psychological effects following incidents such as robbery or other forms of workplace violence.  This may be required, even if the employee is not physically injured or was not directly involved.
