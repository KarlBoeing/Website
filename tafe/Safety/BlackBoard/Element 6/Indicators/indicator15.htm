      <b>Consultation is planned in a systematic way to fit in with work arrangements throughout the organisation.</b>

      <b>Guidance</b><div style="line-height:6px"><br></div>
This indicator refers specifically to the planning of the consultative mechanism to be used by the organisation.  It would include arrangements to achieve the organisation's high level objectives for consultation (if they exist), to implement broad strategies to achieve the objectives and to comply with relevant occupational safety and health laws relating to consultation.  Planning should result in decisions about who is responsible for various tasks, what resources are required and when tasks are to be completed.  There should also be decisions about the way the effectiveness of the consultative mechanism is to be monitored, measured and reviewed at various levels within the organisation.
<div style="line-height:6px"><br></div>
To meet the requirements of this indicator, the organisation does not have to plan for safety and health representatives and committees, set up in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Act 1984, unless there is a request made by employees in accordance with the Act.
<div style="line-height:6px"><br></div>
There should be evidence of a systematic approach to planning the organisation's consultative mechanism, as outlined above.  There should be a major planning exercise that considers the organisation's consultative mechanism at least once a year.  The planning process should result in strategies that suit the organisation's needs.  It would not be acceptable to simply adopt a plan for consultation that has been developed elsewhere.
<div style="line-height:6px"><br></div>
Planning may be in accordance with a recognised quality assurance, safety management or similar Standard.
