      <b>Everyone in the organisation understands the general requirements of occupational safety and health laws.</b>
       <div style="line-height:6px"><br></div>
      <b>Guidance</b>
<div style="line-height:6px"><br></div>
In Western Australia, the occupational safety and health laws referred to in this indicator are in the Occupational Safety and Health Act 1984.  This indicator is not intended to cover specific regulations or codes of practice.  The general requirements include the general duties for employers, self-employed people, people in control of workplaces, employees and others as set out in the Act.  Parts of the Act relating to the resolution of safety and health issues, general requirements for consultation, the powers of inspectors and laws relating to discrimination are included.
<div style="line-height:6px"><br></div>
There should be a process that ensures everyone knows that there are occupational safety and health laws, understand the content in general terms, understands responsibilities that apply to them and understands the consequences of failing to comply.  The methods used to achieve a reasonable level of understanding can vary from one workplace to another.  Employees should verify that they participated in the process and it was effective.

<div style="line-height:6px"><br></div>Inductions provide an avenue for new employees or those new to the job to be provided information concerning the general duties as they apply to the employer and employee.  Other employees also need to be provided with information or training in the general requirements.
<div style="line-height:6px"><br></div>Where there is a tiered management structure within the organisation, the employer is still vicariously liable for any acts and omissions of these people in relation to work.  It is essential to provide adequate information, training and clear accountabilities
<div style="line-height:6px"><br></div>Where contractors are engaged for the purpose of providing a service, the organisation should be clear as to their responsibility to these people, and provide suitable supervision whilst they are at the workplace.
