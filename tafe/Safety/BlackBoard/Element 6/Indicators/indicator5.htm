In this indicator "everyone" refers to employees and contractors used by the organisation.
<div style="line-height:6px"><br></div>
The organisation should have a process to provide a copy of the policy to every employee and contractor.  The process should also ensure that the policy is read and understood.  Where necessary, there should be special arrangements for people who cannot read English for any reason.  Employees do not have to have a personal copy of the policy, but they should have access to a copy within reasonable time.  The policy could be accessible via a computer system.  Assessors will look for evidence of how this outcome is achieved and how the employer can be confident that the system applies to everyone.
<div style="line-height:6px"><br></div>
Contractors may have their own policy statement; however, they also need to understand the policy of the principal employer at the workplace.
