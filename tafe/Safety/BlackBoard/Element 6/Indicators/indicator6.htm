This could be considered as part of resource allocation but has been included as a separate indicator because lack of time appears to be a common excuse given to justify why occupational safety and health activities have not been completed.  It is a factor of work organisation and the priority that is assigned to safety management by everyone in the organisation.
<div style="line-height:6px"><br></div>
Everyone should understand their occupational safety and health duties and complete set tasks in an agreed time.  Time management processes would be well documented, monitored, reviewed and continuously improved.  IN situations where lack of time is a problem, there should be effective processes to correct the situation before a person fails to complete a task on time.  Employees should confirm that the system is working and, as a general rule, there is enough time to complete the occupational safety and health tasks allocated to them.
