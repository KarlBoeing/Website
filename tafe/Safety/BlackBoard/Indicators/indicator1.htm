      <b>Guidance</b>
<div style="line-height:6px"><br></div>

Whatever structure your organisation has, if there are employees, there will be an "employer " as defined in occupational safety and health laws and this person or group will have a general duty of care to provide and maintain workplaces where employees and other people are not exposed to hazards.
<div style="line-height:6px"><br></div>
Act reference number _________________
<div style="line-height:6px"><br></div>
In some situations, including the use of contractors, there may be a "principal employer".
<div style="line-height:6px"><br></div>
The "employer" (or "principal employer") should understand that he/she is the person defined as the "employer" under occupational safety and health laws. They should be aware of the general duties that apply to them and that they are responsible for employees, contractors and visitors to workplaces under their control. Assessors will look for evidence that the employer has been identified and has an adequate level of understanding of the occupational safety and health responsibilities that are associated with the position. 
<div style="line-height:6px"><br></div>
There should be an effective process that makes all employees and contractors aware of who the "employer" is and that the employer is responsible for providing and maintaining a work environment where they are not exposed to hazards.
<div style="line-height:6px"><br></div>
There should be documents that identify the employer and make it clear that the employer understands and accepts relevant responsibilities under occupational safety and health laws. Changes to the law should be monitored and supporting documentation should be reviewed and re-endorsed when changes occur at least once per year.
