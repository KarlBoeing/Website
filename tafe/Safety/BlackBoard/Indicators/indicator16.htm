This indicator looks at the implementation of an effective process for consultation regarding hazard management for occupational safety and health at various levels in the organisation.  It requires the Assessor to evaluate the organisation's approach to hazard management, to test the effectiveness of the consultative mechanism that is in place.
<div style="line-height:6px"><br></div>
To achieve a satisfactory rating, there should be a consultation mechanism for all employees, including shift workers and employees at remote locations.  In relation to hazard management, the consultation mechanism should be working effectively. The consultation mechanism used by the organisation should comply with relevant laws.
<div style="line-height:6px"><br></div>
To meet the requirements of this indicator, the organisation does not have to have safety and health representatives and a committee, set up in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Act 1984, unless there is a request made by employees in accordance with the Act.  However, if the consultative mechanism is set up in accordance with the Act, the organisation must comply with the laws relating to the safety and health representatives and/or committees to achieve a satisfactory rating for this indicator.
<div style="line-height:6px"><br></div>
Employees should be able to confirm that they are consulted regarding the implementation, monitoring and review of measures used to reduce risk, especially in their area of responsibility.  For general matters, employees may not be consulted personally, but they should confirm that the process set up for them to have some input, possibly via representatives, is working.  For matters relating specifically to their job, employees should confirm that they have opportunities to provide personal comment.
