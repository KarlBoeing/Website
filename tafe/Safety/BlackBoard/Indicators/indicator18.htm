The requirements of this indicator support the hazard identification process.  It is important for the organisation to collect information about the work-related injuries and diseases that are occurring so action can be taken to prevent similar events in the future.  This is consistent with the overall approach to reduce the risk of work-related injuries and diseases.
<div style="line-height:6px"><br></div>
Serious accidents and minor injuries resulting in the need for first aid treatments should be recorded using the same basic principles.  This is because sometimes a minor injury could have been much worse in slightly different circumstances. This indicator refers to internal arrangements for reporting work-related injuries and diseases, as well as the reporting of prescribed injuries as set out in occupational safety and health laws.
<div style="line-height:6px"><br></div>
There should be systematic reporting and recording of all work-related injuries and diseases.  Where there is a requirement to report injuries or diseases to WorkSafe, this should be complied with.
