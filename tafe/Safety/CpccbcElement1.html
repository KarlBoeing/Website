   <p><b>The Regulation Part 3 — Workplace safety requirements in 
     Division 1 — 12 cover all  issues of the workplace. Other risk that must be considered are found in Part 4-Plant and Part&nbsp;5-Hazardous substances.</b></p>
   
   <p> After an accident or dangerous incident, an investigation is vital and
     every detail counts. It provides valuable information that can assist
     in determining what happened and the actions required to prevent a
     similar incident in the future. </p>
<div style="line-height:6px"><br />
</div>
One of the duties of SHRs is to participate in investigations for all occupation in the building industry.
However, investigations should be carried out by a team so
everyone can contribute their skills and expertise.

A common practice in an accident/incident investigation is to look
for the cause. This can be restrictive as it focuses attention
on only one, or at best a very few, of the risk factors. Others, that
may be more easily controlled, pass unnoticed.

SHRs and their employers need to investigate accidents or
incidents. There are publications that  provides information on how to conduct
an investigation and what to look for during the investigation. Here are some points:

<b>How to assess the risks in your workplace</b>
<div style="line-height:6px"><br />
</div>
Don’t overcomplicate the process. In many organisations, the risks are well known
and the necessary control measures are easy to apply. You probably already know
whether, for example, you have employees who move heavy loads and so could
harm their backs, or where people are most likely to slip or trip. If so, check that
you have taken reasonable precautions to avoid injury.
<div style="line-height:3px"><br />
</div>
If you run a small organisation and you are confident you understand what’s
involved, you can do the assessment yourself. You don’t have to be a health and
safety expert.
<div style="line-height:3px"><br />
</div>
If you work in a larger organisation, you could ask a health and safety advisor to
help you. If you are not confident, get help from someone who is competent. In all
cases, you should make sure that you involve your staff or their representatives in
the process. They will have useful information about how the work is done that will
make your assessment of the risk more thorough and effective. But remember, you
are responsible for seeing that the assessment is carried out properly.
<div style="line-height:6px"><br />
</div>
When thinking about your risk assessment, remember:
<div style="line-height:3px"><br />
</div>
<div style="text-indent:25px">
  <li> a hazard is anything that may cause harm, such as chemicals, electricity,
    working from ladders, an <br />
  </li>
</div>
<div style="text-indent:40px"> open drawer etc</div>
<div style="line-height:3px"><br />
</div>
<div style="text-indent:25px">
  <li> the risk is the chance, high or low, that somebody could be harmed by these
    and other hazards,<br />
  </li>
</div>
<div style="text-indent:40px"> together with an indication of how serious the harm could
  be. </div>
<div style="line-height:9px"><br />
</div>
<b>a) 
&nbsp;Identify the hazards</b>
<div style="line-height:3px"><br />
</div>
First you need to work out how people could be harmed. When you work in a
place every day it is easy to overlook some hazards, so here are some tips to help
you identify the ones that matter:
<div style="line-height:3px"><br />
</div>
<div style="text-indent:25px">
  <li>Walk around your workplace and look at what could reasonably be expected
    to cause harm.</li>
</div>
<div style="line-height:3px"><br />
</div>
<div style="text-indent:25px">
  <li>Ask your employees or their representatives what they think. They may have
    noticed things that are <br />
  </li>
</div>
<div style="text-indent:40px"> not immediately obvious to you. </div>
<div style="line-height:3px"><br />
</div>
<div style="text-indent:25px">
  <li>If you are a member of a trade association, contact them. Many produce very
    helpful <br />
  </li>
</div>
<div style="text-indent:40px"> guidance.</div>
<div style="line-height:3px"><br />
</div>
<div style="text-indent:25px">
  <li> Check manufacturers’ instructions or data sheets for chemicals and
    equipment as they can be very <br />
    <div style="text-indent:40px"> helpful in spelling out the hazards and putting
      them in their true perspective. </div>
    <div style="line-height:3px"><br />
    </div>
    <div style="text-indent:25px">
  </li>
  <li> Have a look back at your accident and ill-health records – these often help
    to identify the less<br />
  </li>
</div>
<div style="text-indent:40px"> obvious hazards.</div>
<div style="line-height:3px"><br />
</div>
<div style="text-indent:25px">
  <div style="text-indent:25px">
    <li> Remember to think about long-term hazards to health (eg high levels of
      noise or exposure to<br />
    </li>
  </div>
  <div style="text-indent:40px"> harmful substances) as well as safety hazards.</div>
</div>
<div style="line-height:3px"><br />
</div>
<div style="line-height:6px"><br />
</div>
<b>b)
&nbsp;Decide who might be harmed and how</b>
<div style="line-height:3px"><br />
</div>
For each hazard you need to be clear about who might be harmed; it will help you
identify the best way of managing the risk. That doesn’t mean listing everyone by
name, but rather identifying groups of people (eg ‘people working in the storeroom’
or ‘passers-by’).
<div style="line-height:3px"><br />
</div>
In each case, identify how they might be harmed, ie what type of injury or ill health
might occur. For example, ‘shelf stackers may suffer back injury from repeated
lifting of boxes’.
<div style="line-height:6px"><br />
</div>
<b>Remember:</b>
<div style="line-height:3px"><br />
</div>
<div style="text-indent:25px">
  <li>some workers have particular requirements, eg new and young workers, new

<p align="center"><strong>  Hazards iIdentified and documented</strong></p>
<div><br />
</div>
<strong>Categorising hazards</strong>
<div><br />
</div>
Workplace hazards are not always obvious. Some hazards can result in long-term health effects rather than an immediate injury. For example, exposure to loud noise over a period of time can result in hearing loss; or contact with a solvent can cause dermatitis.
<div><br />
</div>
To assist in identifying hazards, they may be categorised as follows:
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
  <li><strong>The obvious hazard</strong> is apparent to the senses (e.g. unguarded machinery, building</li>
</div>
<div>defects, faulty electrical equipment).</div>
<div>
  <li><strong>The concealed hazard</strong> is not apparent to the senses (e.g. electricity, presence of toxic vapours,</li>
</div>
<div>or high frequency noise).</div>
<div>
  <li><strong>The developing hazard </strong>cannot be recognised immediately and will develop over time (e.g.</li>
</div>
<div>a worn tyre on a mobile crane and frayed steel cables).</div>
<div>
  <li><strong>The transient hazard</strong> is an intermittent or a temporary hazard (e.g. overload of machinery,</li>
</div>
<div>when a confined space permit has expired, a sticking safety valve on a boiler, intermittent
  <div>electrical or mechanical defect).</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
It is important to remember that a hazard may become more obvious and easily identifiable when a person actually performs a task. This is often the case with ergonomics or manual tasks.
<div><br />
</div>
To make the job of identifying hazards in the workplace easier, prepare and establish the context for the risk management process. This involves identifying:
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
  <li>all activities involved in work processes and tasks;</li>
</div>
<div>
  <li>who is involved in those activities; and</li>
</div>
<div>
  <li>items of plant or materials that are used.</li>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
Then make a list of all the hazards at the workplace.
<div><br />
</div>
<strong>Hazard Reports</strong>
<div><br />
</div>
Effective hazard reporting is essential for successful hazard management and to meet expected outcomes.
<div><br />
</div>
Implementing the use of Hazard Reports will encourage your staff to identify and report hazards. You can then implement controls before an injury occurs. Encourage staff to complete Hazard Reports for any situation which requires actions beyond simple maintenance.
<div><br />
</div>
Hazard Reports should be:
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
  <li>completed by anyone - employees, managers, contractors, volunteers or residents/families</li>
</div>
<div>
  <li>signed by the person who completes them</li>
</div>
<div>
  <li>investigated, and improvements planned and implemented by the director/supervisor (in<br />
    <div>consultation with staff)</div>
  </li>
</div>
<div>
  <li>signed by a Health and Safety Committee member or employee representative (if there is one)</li>
</div>
<div>
  <li>discussed at a Health and Safety Committee or staff meeting.</li>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
After discussion at a meeting, you should include comments on the effectiveness of action taken on the Hazard Report and Hazard Log. Provide feedback to the staff member who reported the hazard.
