  <p>A example of a Site <em>inspection report template</em> is shown at Element 2 and the hazards of a construction site must be soroughly investigated and recorded in the template. Most companies have already made-up checklists for common hazards. The person doing the inspection should be familiar with two important issues:<br />

        It is then necessary to evaluate the likelihood of an injury occurring, along with its probable consequences. Risk assessments are therefore based on two key factors:
        <ul>
          <li>the likely severity or impact of any injury or illness resulting from the hazard, and</li>
          <li>the probability or likelihood that the injury or illness will actually occur.</li>
        </ul>
        A simple risk matrix, which cross references likelihood and impact, enables risk to be assessed against these two factors and identified as one of the following:
        <ul>
          <li>a critical risk</li>
          <li>a high risk</li>
          <li>a moderate risk</li>
          <li>a low risk</li>
          <li>a very low risk.</li>

                  The effectiveness of administrative controls generally ranges from 10-50%. they typically require significant resources to be maintained over long periods of time for continuing levels of effectiveness. They are also generally highly dependent on worker behaviour.rot<br /></td>
