  <p>Work health and safety in the construction industry is regulated by states and territories. The Occupational Safety and Health Act 1984 (the OSH Act), together with Occupational Safety and Health Regulations 1996 (the Regulations), are the principal legislation governing occupational safety and health in Western Australian workplaces. The WHS Act places the primary duty of care and various other duties and obligations on a <i>'person conducting a business or undertaking' (PCBU)</i>. </p>
  The OSH Act 1984- Part III -General provisions relating to occupational safety and health lists in section the
  <strong>19. Duties of employers</strong> and section the<strong> 20. Duties of employees</strong></strong>
  <p>All persons working on building sites require information, advice, assistance and training to do their  work. They should fully understand the health and safety risks that are part of that work. Linguistic differences can present significant challenges  to communicating health and safety information. Communication to employees should therfore be in  appropriate languages and forms, and  ensure that any employees who do not speak English are properly represented  in consultation on workplace health and safety.</p>
  <p> The application  of different health communication  strategies and educational programs needs a customized approach and should be tailered to the building and consruction industry. </p>
  <p>In most cases companies have the objects of the Work Health and Safety Act (the WHS  Act), which is to provide for fair and effective workplace representation, consultation, cooperation  and issue resolution in relation to work health and safety. </p>
 
  The law requires employers to provide, so far as is reasonably practicable,  a safe working environment for their employees. All employees require information, advice, assistance and training to do their
work; fully understand the health and safety risks that are part of that work;
and help keep their work environment safe.

  <p>It would be too burdensome for employers to do a safety induction course for  persons who would  works/visits   building site. 
So most employers isits that persons have  the nesessary safety traning when they want to work/visit constuction site. The possesion of the   
  Construction Induction Card (White Card)
  exempt the emloyer fom his duty of safety training. See <i>Safety-Legislation</i> site for White Card courses. <font size="1">(WorkSafe changed the design of construction induction cards from 'blue' to 'white' as a result of harmonisation of training across all States and Territories.) </font>  
  <p><strong>Safety Officer</strong><br />
  By law builders are reponsible for the Health and Safety for their employees. Therefore most builders appoint <strong>Safety Officer</strong> to ensure  
 <em>Workplace Health and Safety</em>.  Some of the duties of Safety Officer are listed below: <br />
    ► provide advice, information and instruction on local OHS issues<br />
    ► assist in the application of OHS procedures<br />
    ► help manage risks and hazards in their area<br />
    ► report and investigate incidents, injuries and hazards and implement agreed control measures<br />
    ► review and analyse injury and incident reports and data<br />
    ► develop injury and incident prevention strategies for their area<br />
    ► monitor local area compliance with OHS policy and procedures<br />
    ► help promote OHS awareness.  
  <p>Model work health and safety laws consist of the Model <strong>W</strong>ork <strong>H</strong>ealth and <strong>S</strong>afety (WHS) Act, supported by model WHS regulations, model Codes of Practice.   
 
  Please note that these  are commonweath laws. Most references are made to WA safety laws<p> <strong>Health and Safety Representative</strong> <font size="1">Part 7 Occupational Health and Safety Act 2004 (OHS Act)</font> <br /> 
    The OHS Act provides for the election of HSRs  to  represent the employees in Designated Work Groups (DWGs) .<br />
    A builder who conducts a business  must consult  with workers who carry out work for the business   who are affected by a work health or safety matter.
    A worker may ask for a Health and Safety Representative (HSR) to be elected to  represent them on work health and safety matters.
    Workers would contact the <a href="http://www.ohsrep.org.au/law-rights/ohs-legislation/the-ohs-act/health-and-safety-representatives" target="_window">union</a> official to organise the election of a HSR. HSRs   ensure that workers&rsquo; views are heard on 
  WHS matters.<br />
  <p><strong>Health and Safety  Committees</strong> <font size="1">(39B. Employer may establish  S&amp;Hcommittee;

  39C S&amp;H  committee, agreement as to members etc).</font>
<br />
  Employers must establish an HSC within three months after being  requested to do so by an HSR. Committees bring together
  employees’ knowledge and experience of jobs and tasks and the
  employer’s perspective of the workplace.</div>
  Employer representatives on the HSC should be persons involved at
  senior management levels in the organisation who are able to make
  decisions about health and safety.
  
<p>  <strong> OHS Management</strong>
<br />  
Builders can help to protect themselves and their employees by implementing an occupational health and safety management system (OHSMS). OHSMS helps builders to continually improve their safety performance and compliance to health and safety legislation and standards.
The AS/NZS 4801:2001 standard sets out the requirements you&rsquo;ll need to meet for an effective health and safety management system. Based on established Health and Safety standards, they are designed to work for builders of all sizes and from across all sectors.  A periodically  review of policy and objectives to confirm they are still appropriate and delivering intended outcomes.<br />

  <span class="style10">AS/NZS 4801:2001Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems Specification with guidance for use.</span>
<p>This continual monitoring and review will require appropriate administration systems as outlined in the following extracts  of 4801:2001, Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems.

<p>The implementation of OHSMS confronts barriers in several important and growing sections  of business. These are summarised below:

 <p>Three types of barrier to OHSMS success were distinguished. These are listed in Section 8 Conclusion:

<br />
8.2 Barriers to OHSMS Success.......Page 57
 <p>
  The management system  must be monitored and reviewed against explicit criteria. Risk Criteria are developed at the outset of the Risk Management Process and should be continually reconsidered as part of the review process. 
<p>The <a href="wsplan_assesssystem.pdf">WorkSafe WA workbook</a>    is an audit plan and a tool for review of a Safety and Health Management System.
