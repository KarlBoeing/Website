  The Occupational Safety and Health Act 1984 (the OSH Act) and Occupational Safety and Health Regulations 1996 (the Regulations), together with the Code's of Practice are the principal legislation governing occupational safety and health in Western Australian workplaces.<br>

           <h3>CPCCOHS1001A Work safely in the construction industry (White Card)</h3>
           <p><strong>Construction white cards are required by construction  workers before they enter any construction site.</strong> Workers are required to present their white card to the site supervisor at inductions or prior to entering the construction site.<br />
           This unit  of competency supports the attainment of the  basic OHS knowledge required prior to undertaking  designated work tasks within any of the sectors within the  construction industry. The unit relates directly to the  general induction training program specified by the  National Code of Practice for Induction for Construction  Work</p>
		      	 <h3> Manage occupational  health and safety in the building and  construction workplace </h3>
		<p>The unit (CPCCBC4002A) applies to individuals with managerial responsibility for providing a systematic approach to hazard identification, risk assessment and risk control, with the emphasis on elimination or, where this is not possible, minimisation of risk. It also includes conceptual models for understanding the nature of hazards. <a href="http://www.commerce.wa.gov.au/worksafe/small-business-safety">Small business safety</a> has been developed using the best small business workplace safety programs and has helped over 3000 small businesses around Western Australia improve safety in their workplace.</p>
	 <p>A systematic approach is particularly helpful when there is <strong>limited knowledge</strong> about the hazards and how to control the risks in the particular circumstances</p>

        </p>
        <p> If an organisation develops a safety &amp; health policy it will consider safety statistics to control safety and health risks. The organization need to recognise that there is no <strong>single</strong> reliable measure of health and safety performance.</p>
