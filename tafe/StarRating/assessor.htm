      <p> All residential buildings in Western Australia must comply with the 
        Energy Efficiency Measures (EEM) of the Building Code of Australia (BCA). Energy performance must be demonstrated when obtaining development approval, as well as when applying for building approval.
      </p>
       


      <p>The provisions applies to: 
      <li>New Class 1 buildings (single houses) 
      <li>New Class 10 buildings (non habitable) with a conditioned space 
      <li>Certain additions and extensions 
        <p>APPLICATION OF THE PROVISIONS<br>
          There are two options for assessing applications for compliance with 
          the BCA energy efficiency provisions: <br>

            fabric, Part 3.12.1; and (ii) for external glazing and shading, Part

        <p>The Star Rating is a simulation that allocates a value between one 
          and five stars to a building, with five stars being the most efficient 
          (this is called the Building Energy Rating).<br>
        </p>
        <p>A Star Rating of a building demonstrates the expected thermal performance 
          within a specific climate type. It takes into account typical user occupant 
          behaviour patterns and heat energy inputs into the house from appliance 
          (water heaters, stoves, televisions etc.).</p>
        <p>Where a building may be both heated and cooled, the rating reflects 
          the sum of the heating and cooling energy required to maintain the building 
          within a comfort temperature band. In warmer regions (two thirds of 
          Australia) where there is little heating or cooling used, the Star Rating 
          reflects the amount of time that a building maintains a temperature 
          outside of the thermal comfort band.
