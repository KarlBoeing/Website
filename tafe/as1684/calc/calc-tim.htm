      between spacing and span (see Fig.&nbsp;2.18 and Paragraph 2.7.5.

  As can be seen the span of the rafter in the figure below is not quite 
        in agreement with the Code but we will use the figures for the rafter 
        span as calculated below. <img width=602 height=312 src="fig1-02.gif" v:shapes="_x0000_s1030"><br clear=ALL>
      <p class=MsoHeader align=center style='text-align:center;

We use trigonometric functions for the calculation<div style="line-height:4px"><br></div>
The angle <img src="alpha.lc.gif" width="8" height="7"> will be the <b>roof 
        pitch</b><br>
        The opposite site is the <b>rise of the roof</b><br>
        The adjacent side is the<b> rafter run</b><br>
        The hypotenuse is the <b>true length of the rafter</b><br>
      <p>The example shows brick veneer construction (see Figure 1) the roof pitch 
        is 20°, the rafter run is 3.340 metre<span
lang=EN-US>s and for an eaves width of 0.6 metres, the actual measurement to calculate 
        the overhang is in this case 0.76 metres (0.60 + 0.16 face brick + cavity)</span>.</p>
      <p> <img src="equat1-04.gif" width="249" height="125" align="absmiddle"><img src="fig2-06.gif" width="214" height="202" align="top"> 
          
      <p><b>Therefore the span of the rafter is 3.554 metre.</b></p>
      <p>Please remember that the rafter span according to the Code is the face-to-face 
        distance and that our calculated distance is 96&nbsp;mm longer in this 
        case (see Figure 2). This provides a safety margin, and in a border case, 
        where the span is just a couple of mm too short, you may use the face-to-face 
        distance for the span.</p>    
		<b>Calculation of roof overhang </b><div style="line-height:2px"><br></div>
  You need to distinguish between clad timber framing and a brick-veneer construction 
      calculate the eaves overhang. Look also at Figure 2.18 (b) in Section 2 
      of the code regarding the length of the overhang.
<div style="line-height:2px"><br></div>
Let's assume an eaves width of 600 mm. The 
        horizontal dimension for the overhang is then 600 mm plus the 110 mm brick 
        wall plus the 50 mm cavity, which equals 760&nbsp;mm. <div style="line-height:2px"><br></div>
      Now do the same as for the rafter (the overhang is in this case the Hypotenuse).
<p> <img
src="fig3-08.gif" align=right hspace=12 v:shapes="_x0000_s1037" width="240" height="201"><sub> 
        </sub> <img src="equat2-10.gif"></p>
      <p>The eaves overhang for the brick veneer building with 600 mm eaves width 
        is <u>0.809&nbsp;metre</u></p>
    
    <b>Find the length of a strut</b><div style="line-height:2px"><br></div>
   If a rafter is supported on to points only <span lang=EN-US>(single span) 
        </span>and an appropriate size cannot be found in the tables then an additional 
        support (underpurlin) is needed. Underpurlin
        must be supported by struts.<div style="line-height:2px"><br></div>
<p>Struts may be arranged vertically as shown in Figure 4  (a) or perpendicular 
        to the rafter (b). &nbsp; <img src="fig4-12.gif" width="534" height="367"><br clear=ALL>
      <p> The position of the underpurlin must be determined before you can calculate 
        the length of the strut. To utilise the continuous span of a rafter the 
        position of the underpulin must be in the middle one-third of the rafter 
        as shown in the Figure 5. Remember that continuous span member is a member 
        whereby no span is greater than twice another (Section 2, Paragraph 2.7.5.5).<br>
      <img width=602
 height=340 src="fig5-14.gif"> 
   As soon as you have determined the position of the underpurlin you can 
        calculate the length of the vertical strut using <i>sin</i>, <i>cos</i> 
        or <i>tan</i>. However, the underpurlin in class examples is usually placed 
        at midspan, because that simplifies the calculation for all roof-members 
        of the Roof Framing Section.<div style="line-height:18px"><br></div>

        <b>Perpendicular strut</b><div style="line-height:2px"><br></div>
 To calculate the length of a strut perpendicular

        </span>first. The rafter span (strut at midspan) is <span style='font-family:"Bookshelf Symbol 4";"Times New Roman";"Bookshelf Symbol 4"'></span>

      <div align="left"><b>Fan strut</b> </div>
      <div style="line-height:2px"><br></div>
The span of an underurlin can be reduced if a fan-strut is used instead of a single 
      strut. Paragraph 7.2.15.3 in AS 1684.2 - 2006 stipulates that the angle 
      of a fan-strut should not exceed 45°. <br>
      (A single strut should not be less than 30° from the vertical.) <div style="line-height:2px"><br></div>
   Fan struts are more effective with steeper roof pitches where the length of 
      the strut is notable.<div style="line-height:2px"><br></div>
To reduce the span of an underpurlin effectively the fan strut should have an 
      angle of 45° because this results in a maximum spread of the fan strut.
	  <div style="line-height:12px"><br></div>
<b>Find the spread of a fan strut.</b><div style="line-height:6px"><br></div>
     Geometrically the fan strut should consists of two isosceles right angle 
      triangles as shown in Figure 6. As both angles are the same therefore both 
      sides must be the same. Check on your calculator the <i>sin</i> of 45° (= 
      0,707) and <i>cos</i> 45° (= 0.707) and you will see that you will get equal 
      figure for both (<i>sin</i> and <i>cos</i>).<img src="figfanstrut.gif" align="left"> 
      <p style='line-height:110%;'>In the previous calculation the length of the 
        vertical strut is 0.608 m (at midspan)<span style='font-family:"Bookshelf Symbol 4";"Times New Roman";"Bookshelf Symbol 4"'></span><span lang=EN-US> 
        </span> and the length of the perpendicular strut 0.647 m (at midspan)</p>
     The spread of a <b><i>vertical</i></b> fan 
        strut is therefore                   0.608 x 2 = <u>1.216 m</u><br>
     and<br>
the spread of a strut <b><i>perpendicular</i></b> to the rafter fan 
        strut is therefore<br>
        0.647 x 2 = <u>1.294 m</u></p>
      <p>The calculation of load width and roof area supported is easily understood 
        if you consider the load on a structural member. Ask yourself what load 
        is going onto a member. Study Section 2 of the code and look at the Figure 
        2.10 &amp; 2.11 Floor Load Width (FLW), Figure 2.12 Ceiling Load Width 
        (CLW) and Figure 2.13 - 2.16 Roof Load Width (RWL) and make sure you understand 
        the significance of the load width. 
      <div style="line-height:12px"><br></div>
      <font size="3"><b>Roof area supported (RAS)</b></font> 
      <div style="line-height:2px"><br></div>
     For dimensioning of strutting beams (7.3.11), combined counter-strutting 
      beams (7.3.10) or combined strutting/hanging beams (7.3.9) you need to know 
      the roof area supported. The area can be easily found by be multiplying 
      the RLW with the length of the underpurlin <font face="verdana" size="-1" color="888">(½ x span 1 + ½&nbsp;x span 2)</font> that the strut supports. Usually 
      we select only one size for the underpurlin and therefore only the worst 
      case need to be considered. Find out how many strutting beams are needed. 
      As soon you have determined how many strutting beams are required identify 
      the worst case. This situation will be used for the size selection of the 
      underpurlin. 
      <div style="line-height:2px"><br></div>
Figure 7 below is an example that illustrate the process to find RAS. RAS equals 
      the RLW of the underpurlin multiplied by the longest span of the underpurlin. 
	  <div style="line-height:2px"><br></div>
      Refer to Figure 7 to find the worst case in the roof structure (longest 
      underpurlin span). The strut on the left is vertical because the span on 
      the left side of the strut is less then the reduced span 1. The span between 
      the struts supported on walls is excessive and a strutting beam or combined 
      counter-strutting beam is required. A fan struts have been chosen (see Figure 
      7) to reduce the span of the underpurlin even more (span u/p 1 and span 
      u/p 2). As can be seen span u/p 1 has been reduced by &frac12; spread of 
      the fan strut resulting in a reduce span 1. Span u/p 2 is reduced by the 
      spread of the fan struts (left and right side) i.e. reduce span = span u/p 
      2 minus strut height &times2 ).<br>

		Where it is not possible to support  underpurlins off  walls or struts  some alternatives can be applied as shown in Figure 8. Often  underpurlins are  projected (cantilevered) more than  25% of the maximum allowable span then you may reinforce the hiprafter with a tie-bolt truss system. The hiprafter in this case will support the underpurlin.<div style="line-height:4px"><br></div>
