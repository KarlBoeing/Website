 rarity here in WA and the students thoroughly enjoyed getting detailed information about this project. They were confronted with many issues that they have never thought of. Special thanks to the tour guide Mr. Quinton Myers who answered all the question
s which the students had.

However, as an engineer myself I am concerned about a couple of issues that I would like to discuss. First of all I found water penetration occurring at a number of construction joints in the floor slab. I discovered there is only 
one water-stop-profile at the bottom of the slab that is not doing the job properly. Unfortunately I could not see whether it was incorrectly installed or whether it was in an unsuitable constructional position. The water-stop should be placed in a higher
 position (approx. 250 mm from the bottom of the slab) where its effectiveness can be checked. To be on the safe side and to make sure water penetration will not occur, a second water-stop should be installed (approx. in the middle of the slab).
\par Furthermore
 the middle columns had cardboard wrapped around them. This should not be done because it assists the water to permeate easily through the cardboard. To be able to cut the concrete filled steel column a strip of approx. 100 mm placed at the top of the sla
b would be sufficient.
\par An additional measurement would be to pour the slab in longer sections to minimise number of construction joints.
\par }\pard\plain \s15\widctlpar\adjustright \cgrid {You will be aware that the project is still a contentious issue and I sincerely wish that the bypass-tunnel would be a successful project without major maintenance problem after the official opening.
