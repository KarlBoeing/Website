Take a small handful of your local soil. What descriptive words would you use to describe your soil?

Is it rough and gritty? If you answered yes to these questions your soil is probably sandy. (Sand is usually light in color.)
\par {\pntext\pard\plain\fs20 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 3.\tab}}\pard \ql \fi-360\li360\ri0\widctlpar\jclisttab\tx360{\*\pn \pnlvlbody\ilvl0\ls1\pnrnot0\pndec\pnstart1\pnindent360\pnsp120\pnhang{\pntxta .}}\faauto\ls1\adjustright\rin0\lin360\itap0 {\fs20

Add a small amount of water to your soil. Does it form a loose lump in your hand when you squeeze the wet soil? Your soil is probably a silty soil. (Silt is usually medium brown in color.)
\par {\pntext\pard\plain\fs20 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 5.\tab}}\pard \ql \fi-360\li360\ri0\widctlpar\jclisttab\tx360{\*\pn \pnlvlbody\ilvl0\ls1\pnrnot0\pndec\pnstart1\pnindent360\pnsp120\pnhang{\pntxta .}}\faauto\ls1\adjustright\rin0\lin360\itap0 {\fs20 
When you added the water to your soil and squeezed it in your h
and did it form a tight lump? Was it sticky? Your soil is probably clay. (The color can be reddish or gray.) It may even have a plastic like-texture and form a ribbon when pressed through your fingers. Check your hands. Did the soil leave a stain? Clay so
il can also stain your skin.

Is it possible that your soil won't fit completely into one category? Does it feel like it has characteristics of all three types of soil, or is it possible you just can't seem to identify any predominant soil type? If this 
is true, it is probably loam. Loam has significant proportions of all three soil types. (Loam usually has a dark brown color.)
\par {\pntext\pard\plain\fs20 \hich\af0\dbch\af0\loch\f0 7.\tab}}\pard \ql \fi-360\li360\ri0\widctlpar\jclisttab\tx360{\*\pn \pnlvlbody\ilvl0\ls1\pnrnot0\pndec\pnstart1\pnindent360\pnsp120\pnhang{\pntxta .}}\faauto\ls1\adjustright\rin0\lin360\itap0 {\fs20 
Often soil is a combination of all three soil types. Use the type that is the closest to your soil. For example, if it has a 
lot of gritty particles that are light in color and some fine particles that are sticky when moist, you would call it a sandy clay. Soils that are red and hard, yet sticky when moist would be clay. Soils of dark brown color which easily crumble when moist
 may be loam. If it has a gritty feel as well it may be a loamy sand. The most predominant type is named first.

\par }{\b\fs28 How is soil formed?
\par }{\fs20 
\par Soil comes from rock that has been broken into small pieces. Rocks have tiny cracks and holes in them which fill up with water and/or ice. Over time, the water breaks the rock apart into tiny pieces of various sizes which combine with air, water, and deca
yed plant and animal matter to form soil. 
\par 
\par What are the most common kinds of soil?
\par }{\b\fs20 
\par Humus}{\fs20 : The topsoil layer is usually where you can find humus. It is the combination of the decaying plant and animal matter. Soil that is rich in humus is dark in color and
 is full of the nutrients that plants need to grow strong. Humus coats the sand, silt and clay and binds them together in the topsoil. 
\par 
\par }{\b\fs20 Clay}{\fs20 : Clay soil has very fine particles that are tightly packed and hold water well. It is waterlogged in the winter an
d very dry in the summer. Lots of plants cannot grow in clay soil because the tiny particles in the soil are so close together. 
\par }{\b\fs20 
\par Sandy}{\fs20 : Sandy soil is a light, coarse, crumbly soil that is easy to dig. Sandy soil is not a good growing environment for plants because it does not hold water and has few nutrients. 
\par 
\par }{\b\fs20 Loam}{\fs20 : Loam is a blend of clay, sand and humus. Generally, plants grow well in this soil. 
\par 
\par 
\par How do you know which kind of soil is in your topsoil?
\par 
\par One way to tell what kind of soil you may have in 
your backyard is by examining the soil's texture or how it feels. Try taking a small amount of soil, moistening it and rubbing it between your fingers. If the soil feels really gritty, then that means it has lots of sand in it. If it feels sticky, then it
 has lots of clay in it, and you may be able to form it into a ball in your hand. Loam feels spongy and crumbly at the same time, and soil with lots of silt in it is smooth like flour. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par Soil Composition
\par 
\par 1.Spread soil into tray.
\par 2.Put some soil into a mortar and pestle. Break apart the soil into tiny bits.
\par 3.Place the crumbled soil into a jar until it measures a height of 5 centimeters.
\par 4.Add water until about 2 inches of water covers the top of the soil.
\par 
\par 5.Mix the soil and water and let stand for 24 hours. Be sure to label the jar with the type of soil. 
\par 6.As the soil settles, different size particles will settle out into different layers, forming a soil profile. The largest particles will be on the bottom, and the smallest particles will be on the top.
\par 7.Use the diagram to determine the soil layers of your soil sample.
\par 8.Measure the thickness of each layer in the soil sample. Record the thickness of each layer.
\par 9.To determine the percentage of soil represented by each layer, divide the thickness of a layer by the total thickness of all the layers in the jar. Record the percentages. 
\par 
\par 
\par Questions:
\par 1.What material formed the thickest layer of your soil profile?
\par 2.Indentify the soil type that had the thickest layer of: 
\par gravel
\par sand
\par silt
\par clay
\par 
\par 3.Which type of soil had the least amount of: 
\par gravel
\par sand
\par silt
\par clay
\par 
\par 4.How can you explain these differences in the soil profiles of different samples?
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par How much water will your soil hold? 
\par 
\par Since water is necessary for all living things, it is important for the soil to be able to hold a certain amount of water. It is also necessary for the soil to drain water because if it held too much water it might cause the living organisms to drown. 

\par 
\par 1.Pour about 100 ml. of soil into a clean milk carton. Holes have been punched in the bottom of the milk carton.
\par 2.Hold the milk carton containing the soil over a beaker or jar.
\par 3.Fill a graduated cylinder with 100 ml. of water.
\par 4.Pour the water into the soil in the milk carton.
\par 5.The water will drain through the soil and into the container below. Hold the milk carton over the container until you are sure all of the water has drained through.
\par 6.Wrap the milk carton in paper towels and throw into a trash can. 
\par 7.Pour the water that drained into the container into a graduated cylinder to measure. (Do not throw this water away!)
\par 8.Determine the water holding capacity of your soil. To do this subtract the amount of water you collected in the container from 100 ml. 
\par 
\par 9.Record the amount. 
\par 
\par Questions:
\par 1.Do you think your soil holds enough water to support life in the soil? Why or why not?
\par 2.Which type of soil held the most water? Why?
\par 3.Which type of soil held the least water? Why?
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par Oxygen Content 
\par 
\par 1.Pour some of your soil sample into a culture cup (about 1/2 full).
\par 2.Fill another culture cup about 1/2 full of water.
\par 3.Pour the water slowly into the soil. Notice the water bubbling to the surface. Count the number of water bubbles that form in one minute.
\par 4.Record the number of bubbles.
\par 
\par This determines how much air or oxygen is in the soil. 
\par 
\par Questions:
\par 1.Why is oxygen important to the soil?
\par 2.Which soil held the least oxygen?
\par 3.Which soil held the most oxygen?
\par 4.Explain why different soils would have different oxygen capacities.
\par 5.How would this affect growing things in soil?
\par 
\par 
\par SOIL EROSION
\par 
\par Erosion is the wearing down or washing away of the soil and land by the movement of water, wind, ice. 
\par 
\par How does water erode?
\par Materials
\par \bullet garden hose
\par \bullet water
\par \bullet a slightly inclined area with uncovered earth
\par 
\par Procedure
\par 
\par Turn on the hose and let the water flow through the area, like a tiny stream or river. Have the children make dams, ponds, and canals with the soil, and watch how the course of the water flow may change and how the water erodes the earth.
\par 
\par Try this experiment under pine trees, as the pine needles and soil underneath are adaptable materials for building dams and the like.

\par How Soils Can Work For You 
\par 
\par Why Does the type of soil being retained make a difference? 
\par 
\par Soil has two main properties that are used to determine how much reinforc
ement is required to stabilize a soil mass. The internal strength, soil friction angle or Phi angle, of different soils plays a major role in determining how well soils hold themselves up. This internal strength of the soil, not the retaining wall, perfor
ms most of the work of holding up any hillside. The friction angle of the soil is an indicator on how well the soil will support its own weight. 
\par 
\par Soils also possess a second property which allows the soil to stick together, cohesion. Clay soils have lower internal strengths but higher internal strengths and lower cohesion values. 
\par 
\par How does water effect the soil?
\par 
\par The major cause of hill slides is moisture. Water changes the characteristics of soil in the same way that heat effects ice. As any soil becomes saturated, two things happen: 
\par 
\par }\pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\tx567\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\fs20 \tab \bullet The weight of the mass of soil increases. Once the weight of the soil increases beyond the internal strength of the soil, the mass slumps.
\par \tab \bullet The ability of soil particles to stick together is reduced. 
\par }\pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\tx1276\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0\itap0 {\fs20 
\par Clay soils are comprised of small flat particles that drain away water very slowly. Once a clay soil mass becomes saturated, cohesive properties become negligible. 
\par 
\par Soils with high percentages of sand and gravel are comprised of larger more angular particles. This type of soil has lower cohesive properties but drains away water very rapidly. The ability of the soil to drain provides a more stable soil mass and reduce
s hydrostatic pressure present in saturated soil. The internal strength of sandy soil is also higher. 
\par 
\par What type of aggregate should be used when preparing the base, building the drain field behind the wall and in the cores of the block?
\par 
\par A well graded com
pactible aggregate provides the best base and drain field material. Well graded may be defined as having a wide range in grain sizes and substantial amounts of all intermediate particle sizes. Fines should be minimized as sufficient compaction can be obta
ined with the proper gradation of aggregates. It is not necessary to use different types of material for the base and drain field. 
\par 
\par Crushed stone has several positive features as a backfill material for retaining walls. High internal shear strength, good c
ompaction characteristics and excellent drainage and freeze/thaw resistance capabilities provide the key ingredients needed for trouble free retaining wall construction. 
\par 
\par Can soil behind the wall be over compacted?
\par 
\par Yes! Excess compaction may result in the following situations: 
\par 
\par \bullet Forward rotation of the wall facing. \bullet Localized bulging of the wall facing. \bullet Damage to the reinforcement when sharp angular aggregate is used. 
\par 
\par Retaining wall construction requires a certain amount of compaction to consolidate t
he soil and minimize settlement that occurs after walls have been constructed. Excessive compaction can cause forward rotation of the wall facing. Soil compaction within three feet of the wall must be accomplished with hand operated equipment. Plate compa
c
tors provide the compaction required while minimizing the potential for pushing the wall forward. Large equipment operating too close to the wall is a common problem on commercial construction sites. Concentrated loading from heavy equipment may cause ove
r compaction and result in a rotation of the wall facing of localized bulging. Over compaction may also damage geogrid reinforcement materials. 
\par 
\par More compaction is not always better. Contact the AB Engineering Department for more information on the correct backfill material to use for the job and guidelines on proper compaction.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par WHAT IS COMPACTION?

\par The process of compaction refers to the act of mechanically increasing soil density or unit weight. In this process, the soil particles are moved and rearr
anged closer to each other, and the air that has been trapped between these particles is forced out. This increase in density of the soil increases the ability of the soil to support a load and reduces the possibility of the soil settling. 
\par 
\par COMPACTION TECHNIQUE - A MIXTURE OF ART AND SCIENCE 
\par There is obviously more than one way to get the job done. Vibratory plates have been a popular method for many years. While they do keep men out of the trenches and are effective in some situations, they still have de
ficiencies that keep them from being effective in a large number of other situations. 
\par 
\par 1.Vibratory plates compact from the top down, increasing the probability of bridging the surface while lumps below the surface remain unbroken and voids around them remain unfilled. 2.Vibration can loosen joints in sewer and water lines. 3.The operator is
 
never sure how fast he can move the plate over the surface and still get good compaction. 4.Vibratory plates do nothing to improve the consistency and mix of the soil. 5.Vibration can undermine nearby slabs. 6.Vibration can damage nearby existing structur
es, utilities and electronic equipment. 
\par 
\par A BETTER CHOICE
\par Since the early 1980's, a newer technique has been steadily gaining popular acceptance because of it's versatility and effectiveness. The boom mounted compaction wheel is the best combination of all 
known methods and has the following advantages over a vibratory plate: 
\par 
\par 1.A wheel compacts from the bottom up, eliminating the possibility of bridging the surface as it agressively breaks up the lumps and fills in the voids. 2.It kneads and mixes the soil
 as it compacts for a more uniform consistency. 3.The soil density achieved is not compromised by traveling too fast. 4.A wheel can effectively handle greater lift thicknesses. Typical lifts are 12"-24" (loose mat'l) for backhoes and 18"-36" for excavator
s. 5.Six to eight passes usually get required densities. 
\par 
\par VARIABLES THAT AFFECT COMPACTIBILITY
\par 
\par 1.TYPE OF SOIL AND IT'S COMPACTIBILITY. 
\par Highly plastic clay and dry sand are both very difficult to compact. A combination of the two is an ideal soil type. 
\par 
\par 2.MOISTURE CONTENT OF THE SOIL BEING COMPACTED. 
\par If the voids between soil particles are full of water, you will merely push on the water when trying to move the soil particles into the voids. The water will not be compressed. The optimum moisture content 
should be in the range of 12-18%. This amount of moisture lubricates the soil particles without interfering with the compaction effort. While 12-18% is ideal, it may be nearly impossible to attain in the field. 
\par That is why it is wise to choose a piece of equipment that MIXES and KNEADS as it compacts, as happens with a compaction wheel. At least whatever moisture you do have will be distributed more evenly. 
\par 
\par 3.HARD LUMPS OF HEAVY CLAY are often present in material that has been removed with a hoe bucket. 
This type of soil will resist any attempt to rearrange soil particles by moving them closer together. Vibration is usually not enough to tear stubborn soil particles apart. 
\par AGGRESSIVE PHYSICAL CONTACT, exactly like that produced by a compaction wheel, is necessary to break up the lumps by SHEARING the soil particles apart from each other. 
\par 
\par 4.OPTIMUM LIFT THICKNESS for soil type and compaction method is another variable that is very difficult to control in the field. When an operator is pushing material in
to a trench with a dozer blade, it's hard to tell the difference between 12" and 24" from where he is sitting. 
\par A compaction wheel that HELPS SPREAD THE MATERIAL as it compacts will be most useful in this regard. 
\par 
\par 5.SPEED OF TRAVEL is most critical with vibratory equipment. Too little time spent over the area to be compacted will result in poor compaction, while too much time is an unnecessary waste. 
\par A compaction wheel is NOT SENSITIVE TO THE SPEED OF OPERATION. You will get the same compaction result from a fast or slow motion. 
\par 
\par 6.TYPE OF COMPACTION EFFORT 
\par The four basic methods are: 
\par 1.Static Weight 2.Kneading 3.Vibration (more than 25 cycles per second) 4.Tamping (less than 25 cycles per second)
\par 
\par In addition to the variables listed above, you must also take into consideration the choice and condition of the equipment employed and the judgment and skill of the operator. Therefore, it is impossible to set hard and fast rules to govern every situatio
n. 
\par 
\par THE FINAL TEST
\par 
\par Why didn't you put everything back into the trench that came out of it? 
\par If you consistently haul material away from a jobsite that has been compacted with a vibratory plate, you have probably left a lot of voids behind.
