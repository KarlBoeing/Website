      <p align="left">Students need to be familiar with the laboratory equipment 
        before they attempt an experiment. A maximum of three students is permitted 
        for group activities.

        We will meet there for the scheduled laboratories. It is the responsibility 
        of students to be there <b>on time</b>.<br>
        Students participation in laboratories is compulsory and anyone who misses 
        a lab <b>cannot</b> pass this unit. A second attempt is unfortunately 
        not possible. Please be aware of this! 
      <p align="left">There are many sites on the Internet which provides you 
        with useful information. Some Internet sites are listed below for additional information on the 
        performance of the experiments that we'll carry out.. 
      <p align="left"><b><U>ASSESSMENT 1</U></b><br>
        <b>Experiment 1 - Soil identification test.</b><br>
    <b>Report 1</b><br>
        Each student has to collect two different soil samples (not clean sandy 
        soils) and to describe and classify them. Some additional soil sample 
        that you need to classify are provided in the lab.<br>

      <p align="left"><b>Experiment 2 - Particle size distribution (sieve analysis)</b><br>
        <b>Report 2</b><br>
        The purpose of this experiment is to determine the grain size distribution 
        of a coarse grained soil using a sieve analysis.<br>
      <p align="left">Click <a href="http://www.engr.usask.ca/~jis397/applets/grainsize/default.html" target="_blank">here</a> 
        for a sieve analysis simulation. Do two (2) computer simulation test.  The computer simulation  will be demonstrated in class.<br>
        The report should include all data and a grain size distribution curve 
        must be plotted on the <a href="exercises/partsize.htm" target="_blank">graph</a> 
        by connecting the points with a smooth curve (best drawn with a French 
        curve). Determine the coefficient of uniformity <font size="-1">(U=D60/D10)</font>. 
        Classify the soil in accordance with the Unified Soil Classification System 
        <a href="http://www.areforum.org/guest/General%20Structures/USCS.pdf" target="_blank">USCS</a>. If the particle size distribution is not done in the laboratory and the simulation test is used for Report 2 then use this special  <a href="Sieve%20Analysis%20Simulation.pdf" target="_blank">simulation-chart</a>

        <b>Experiment 3 - Liquid limit / plastic limit tests</b><br>
        <b>Report 3</b><br>
        The objective of the liquid limit / plastic limit tests (also called Atterberg 
        limits test) is to obtain basic information about the soil to estimate 
        strength and settlement characteristics. It is the primary form of classification 
        for cohesive soils.<br>

        Geotechnical Engineering Laboratory</font>). Students should be familiar 
        with the test procedure prior to the actual lab test.<br>
        <b>Experiment 4 - Soil texture class test</b><br>
        <b>Report 4<br>
        </b>The purpose of this test is to find the percentage distribution of sand, 
        silt and clay in a soil sample. Each student need to collect a soil samples 
        (not pure sandy soil), conduct a glass jar test and determine the soil 
        type using the soil textural classification chart provided. Refer to notes 
        and click on <a href="notesf&g.htm" target="_blank">Soil texture class</a>
