        <b>Experiment 1 - Soil identification test.</b><br>
    <b>Report 1</b><br>
        Each student has to collect two different soil samples (not clean sandy 
        soils) and to describe and classify them. Some additional soil sample 
        that you need to classify are provided in the lab.<br>
         Click <a href="Soil%20Description%20Assessment.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> for information that is required to write up your Report 1. (<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><a href="http://www.soil-net.com/legacy/schools/finger_rub/finger_rub.htm">Click here</a>

      <p align="left"><b>Experiment 2 - Particle size distribution (sieve analysis)</b><br>
        <b>Report 2</b><br>
        The purpose of this experiment is to determine the grain size distribution 
        of a coarse grained soil using a sieve analysis.<br>
      <p align="left">Click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMMC8IP_zg" target="_blank">here</a> 
        for a sieve analysis simulation. Do two (2) computer simulation test.  The computer simulation  will be demonstrated in class.<br>
        The report should include all data and a grain size distribution curve 
        must be plotted on the <a href="exercises/partsize.htm" target="_blank">graph</a> 
        by connecting the points with a smooth curve (best drawn with a French 
        curve). Determine the coefficient of uniformity <font size="-1">(U=D60/D10)</font>. 
        Classify the soil in accordance with the Unified Soil Classification System 
     <a href="http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/resources/soils/testmethods/usc.pdf"> USCS</a>. If the particle size distribution is not done in the laboratory and the simulation test is used for Report 2 then use this special  <a href="Sieve%20Analysis%20Simulation.pdf" target="_blank">simulation-chart</a>

        <b>Experiment 3 - Liquid limit / plastic limit tests</b><br>
        <b>Report 3</b><br>
        The objective of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcBrSKwnDRY">liquid limit / plastic limit test</a> (also called Atterberg 
        limits test) is to obtain basic information about the soil to estimate 
        strength and settlement characteristics. It is the primary form of classification 
        for cohesive soils.<br>
        Students should be familiar 
      with the test procedure prior to the actual lab test.      <br>
        <b>Experiment 4 - Soil texture class test</b><br>
        <b>Report 4<br>
        </b>The purpose of this test is to find the percentage distribution of sand, 
        silt and clay in a soil sample. Each student need to collect a soil samples 
        (not pure sandy soil), conduct a glass jar test and determine the soil 
        type using the soil textural classification chart provided. Refer to notes 
        and click on <a href="notesf&g.htm" target="_blank">Soil texture class</a> 
        test.
