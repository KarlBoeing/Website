<h3>Pressure on retaining structures</h3>	  
      
      <p><b>Liquid pressure</b>
      
<p>From diving experience we know that the pressure in a liquid (e.g. water) 
        becomes greater the deeper we dive. Consider the vertical surface A-B 
        of the wall in Figure 1. The cube situated at depth h exerts a pressure 
        of w &times h (kN) on all its surfaces. If one face of the cube is touching 
        the wall it will exert a pressure onto the wall. 
      <p>The density of water, <img src="img/rho.lc.gif" width="6" height="10"><sub><i>w</i></sub> 
        = 1000 kg/m&#179 = 1Mg/m&#179<br>
        The weight of 1000 kg mass is 1000 &times 9.81 = 9810 N (weight = mass 
        &times gravitational acceleration). Hence the unit weight of water, <img src="img/gamma.lc.gif" width="6" height="10"><sub><i>w</i></sub> 
        9.81 kN/m&#179. Instead of using the exact figure for the gravitational 
        acceleration we approximate this figure to 10 m/s&sup2;. This provides 
        a safety margin of approximately of 2% and on the other hand it suits 
        the decimal system and eases the calculations. <i>w</i> is the equivalent 
        density of water which in our case, will always be 10 kN/m&#179. In the 
        right diagram of Figure 1 the pressure at the surface is zero and at depth 
        h is <i>w</i> &times h. The average pressure of the 'wetted area' between 
        A and B is ½ w &times h (in kN per unit area).

	 <b>Position of the resulting force</b></a></p> 
      <p><img src="img/c-of-g.gif" align="left">The opposite diagram shows the 
        centre of gravity of a triangle in relation to the principle axis. The centre of gravity 
        for all triangles is at a 1/3<sup>rd</sup> from the base. (Any side of the triangle can be the base.) A parallel line from the base at 1/3<sup>rd</sup> 
         of the height of the triangle divides the area into two equal parts (A1=A2). Referring to the above example  
        the resultant force, which equals ½&nbsp;&times&nbsp;w&nbsp;h² (kN) will therefore act at a  point 
         of 1/3<sup>rd</sup> of height from the base.<br>

      <p><img src="img/example-wa.gif" align="left"> A dam retains water on its 
        vertical surface as shown in Figure 6. The dam has a height of 4.5 metre, 
        and the water level is 0.9 metre below the top of the dam.<br>
What is the resultant water pressure per metre run of dam?<br><br>
      <p><b>Solution</b><br>
	   The equivalent density w of water equals 10&nbsp;kN/m&#179</p>
	   
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">P = ½ &times w &times h² <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= ½ &times 10 &times 3.62 <br>

 <h4>Soil pressure (horizontal)</h4></a>
      <p>There is some similarity between the calculation of the lateral pressure 
        in water and soil. However, it is apparent that pressures on vertical 
        surfaces from retained soils cannot be determined with the same accuracy 
        as with water. Soils vary in character and weight and behave quite differently 
        under these varying conditions. There are a number of soil pressure theories 
        for the calculation of soil pressure but only the Rankine's theory will 
        be dealt with.</p>
       <p> As the density of soil can vary there will be a number of different unit 
        weight figures and not only one as for water. Instead of using <i>w</i> 
        as for the density of water, <img src="img/gamma.lc.gif" width="6" height="10"> 
        will be used for the density of soil (see also properties of soil). </p>

      <p>Consider a mass of soil with a horizontal upper surface. If the unit weight of the soil is <img src="img/gamma.lc.gif"> 
        then an element at a depth h below the surface will be subjected to a 
        vertical pressure g &times h. This stress is a major principal stress 
        is, i.e.<img src="img/sigma-lc14.gif" width="3" height="9"><sub>1</sub> 
        = g h (multiplying sign omitted). There is of course also a lateral stress 
        or minor principal stress <img src="img/sigma-lc14.gif"><sub>3</sub>. 
				
        The ratio between the <img src="img/sigma-lc14.gif"><sub>1</sub>/<img src="img/sigma-lc14.gif"><sub>3</sub>

			<p>Consider, for example, 
      the soil retained by the vertical face AB in Figure&nbsp;8. If the wall 
      (retaining face AB) was removed, then some of the soil would probably collapse. 
      After the soil has collapsed it would assume a line BC as shown. The angle 
      <img src="phi.lc.gif"> made between the horizontal and the line BC will 
      vary with different types of soil. This angle is called the <i>Angle of 
      repose</i> or the <i>angle of internal friction</i> of the soil.</p>

      <h4>Active and passive earth pressure </h4>
	  <p>Contemplate a smooth vertical wall supporting a mass of soil at rest 
        in which the lateral pressure on the wall is = K<sub>o</sub> <img src="img/gamma.lc.gif"> 
        h. If the wall is allowed to yield, i.e. move forward slightly, there 
        will be an immediate reduction in the value of lateral stress, but if 
        the wall is pushed slightly into the soil there will be an increase in 
        the value of the lateral pressure.<br>
        The minimum value is known as the <i><b>active earth pressure</b></i>

      <p>Rankine's theory states in general terms that the active earth pressure coefficient is:<br>

      <p>The active earth pressure at a depth h (m) due to a level fill of soil

	  A soil weighing 19 kN/m<sup>3</sup> and having

      3.6 metre high vertical face of a wall.<br>
      <br>
      What is the resultant horizontal force per metre run of wall? <br>

      <p>The total horizontal force from the retained earth acting on the wall 
        surface is: </p>

	  <p>It is of advantages to calculate the individual components, especially 
        if you need to know the E<sub>a</sub> figure. Compare this result with 
        the liquid pressure in Example 1. As you can see the force due to hydrostatic 
        (liquid) pressure is much less than the force due to earth pressure. This 
        results from the internal friction (<img src="phi.lc.gif" width="7" height="13"> 
        higher in sand than in clay) between the grains of the soil represented 
        by the K<sub>a</sub> figure.
