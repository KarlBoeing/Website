    <h3>Consistency limits</h3></a>
	  <p> <b>Liquid limit</b> (LL) is when the soil represents a near liquid state. 
        This occurs at very high water contents when the soil behaves as a viscous 
        liquid in that it flows and will not hold a specific shape. In other words 
        the soil will flow under its own weight.</p>
      <p><b>Plastic limit</b> (PL) is the lowest water content at which the soil 
      exhibits plastic behavior. It is the minimum moisture content at which the 
      soil can be rolled into a thread of 3mm diameter without breaking up.</p> 
      <p><b>Shrinkage limit</b> (SL) is the water content at which there is no 
        more volume change in the soil due to reduction in water. In other words 
        the maximum moisture content at which further loss of moisture does not 
        cause a decrease in the volume of the soil.</p>
      <p><b>Plasticity index</b> (PI) is the range of moisture content in which 
        the soil is plastic; the finer the soil the greater is the plasticity 
        index.</p> 
      <div align="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;Plasticity index = liquid limit - plastic 
        limit<br>
        <b>PI = LL - PL</b> </div>
      <p>Figure 5 shows the different stages of a plastic soil and the volume 
        changes due to moisture content.</p>

              <p align="left">Soils usually are classified according to their 
                grain size. We have coarse-grained non-cohesive and fine-grained 
                cohesive and organic soils. The grain of the various soils are 
                all different. Table 1 below shows the range of particle sizes.</p>
              <p align="left">The distribution of the particles is determined 
                by sieving. The chart shown in Figure 1 is used for the sieve 
                analysis. The percentage of a sample greater than a given size 
                is determined for coarse soils. For fine soils the particle sizes 
                are meaningless. The distinction between silt and clay is made 
                not on the basis of an arbitrary size distinction but on their 
                behaviour in the present of water. The consistency of fine soil 
                varies with the amount of water present.</p>
