<h1>BEARING CAPACITY OF SOILS </h1></a>
      <p>The bearing capacity depends on the behaviour of the ground under a building and its interaction with the foundation. (Note that we make a distinction between footings and foundation. The term foundation may refer in some sources to footings.) The structural load of a building must be safety and economically transferred to the ground without unacceptable settlement.</p>

<p>A site investigation should be carried out to find out what type of structure it supports, its loading and the amount of movement that can be tolerated. For large building constructions a geotechnical site investigation according to AS 1726-1993 should be carried out. The requirements for the classification of a site and the design and construction of a footing system for a single dwelling house, townhouse or the like are found in AS 2870-1996 Residential slabs and footings-Construction.</p>
 

      <p>The <b><i>ultimate bearing capacity</i></b> for a typical foundation 
        base is the average vertical pressure on the ground that leads to failure 
        by shear, in other words the average contact pressure between the foundation 
        and the soil that will produce shear failure in the soil</p>
      
      <p>The <b><i>maximum safe bearing capacity</i></b> is the maximum value 
        of contact pressure to which the soil can be subjected without risk of 
        shear failure. This is based entirely on the strength of the soil and 
        is the ultimate bearing capacity divided by an appropriate factor of safety.</p>
      <p>The <i><b>allowable bearing pressure</b></i> is according AS2870-1996 
        (Residential slabs and footings-Construction) the maximum bearing pressure 
        that can be sustained by the foundation from the proposed footing system 
        under service loads over the design range of soil moisture conditions. 
        Allowable bearing pressure shall be taken into consideration both the 
        site conditions and the ability of the building system to accommodate 
        settlement.<br>
     
     
<h3>Pressure distribution in soil </h3>
      <p>The pressure at depth h in a foundation is due to the weight of the building 
        and the self-weight of the soil above the depth h.<br>
      <p align="center"><img alt="pressure (10K)" src="pressure.gif" height="432" width="579" /><br>
	  <br>
        <h3>Figure 1</h3> 
      <p>Figure 1 illustrates the theory of pressure distribution within the foundation. 
        The soil mass acts as an elastic medium. The circular footing load placed 
        on the soil mass will induce stresses within the soil. The circles, known 
        as bulbs of equal pressure, give an indication of the vertical pressure 
        below the foundation. As can be seen the pressure from the building load 
        decreases (see lower diagram in Figure 1) while the pressure from the 
        self-weight of the soil increases. From the bulb pressure you will get 
        some idea of the depth of soil affected by a footing. The width of a footing 
        determines at what depth the pressure from the building is reduced to 
        a neglected value. The pressure should be followed up to a depth of 2B 
        to 3B (B = footing width)<br>

	  <h4>Bulbs of pressure</h4>
      <p><img src="img/bearing-2.gif" align="left"><br> The bulb of pressure gives 
        an indication of the depth of soil affected by a footing. As can be seen 
        from Figure 2 it is important to investigate the site to a greater depth 
        for large footings. The depth at which the soil pressure need to be considered 
        depends on the size of the proposed footings. A 'plate loading test'* 
        can give misleading results if the proposed footing width is much lager 
        <br>
        than the plate size. Bore holes should <img src="img/40_3-5.gif" width="141" height="13">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Figure  
        2</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>therefore be 
        taken down to a depth of 2<img src="img/40_3-5.gif" width="332" height="14">to 
        3 times the width of the footing. The bulbs of pressure shown in Figure 
        1 indicate vertical stresses at points below a footing.<br>
        * Plate bearing test are used for estimating the allowable load-bearing 
        pressure.<br> 
		
     <h4>Plastic failure theory </h4>
      <p>A number of analyses have been carried out to find the ultimate bearing 
        capacity of the soil, qu, when the footing is at the surface as shown 
        in Figure 3.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="img/soil-flow.gif"> 
      <p align="center"><h3>Figure 3</h3></P>
	 <p> The footing is moving downwards into the soil with no attendant rotation. The triangular wedge of soil immediately below the footing goes down with the footing and suffers no deformation, and creates an area of plastic flow  (I) which is prevented from moving outwards by the passive resistance of wedge (II).</p>
