    <h2 align=center>Soil texture class test </h2>
<p>The natural soil consists usually of a mixture of sand, silt and clay. If a soil contains mostly sand and some clay then we would call it clayey sand. There exists an international texture classification that refers to the descriptive names of the soil. In this classification the descriptive names refer to a percentage composition with the following size limitations:</p>
	  <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sand&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	
        2.0 to 0.06 mm diameter<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0.06 
        to 0.002 mm diameter<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clay&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	
        smaller than 0.002 mm diameter</b></p>
      <p><img src="img/jar-test.gif" width="200" height="214" align="left"><br>
        The find the percentage distribution of sand, silt and clay a soil sample 
        from the site should be taken.<br>
        Fill a container with water and add the soil sample to it.<br>
        Shake the container vigorously and leave it standing until the soil particles 
        have settled.<br>
        Then measure the layer thickness of each layer as shown in Figure&nbsp;3. 
        All layers add up to 80 mm. We find the percentage of the different layers 
        by dividing the single layer thickness by the total thickness of all layers 
        (that is 80 mm.). The percentages are shown below. </p>

        A textural classification chart is shown in Figure 4 below. To find the 
        soil classification place the percentage figure on the chart as shown. 
        Knowing the percentage distribution of a specific soil any classification 
        can be quickly worked out.

      <h3>Soil texture class descriptions </h3>
      <p><b>Sand</b><br>
        Soil consisting mostly of coarse and fine sand, and containing so little 
        clay that it is loose when dry and not sticky at all when wet. When rubbed 
        it leaves no film on the fingers.</p>
      <p><b>Loamy sand</b><br>
        Consisting mostly of sand, but with sufficient clay to give slight plasticity 
        and cohesion when very moist. Leaves slight film of fine materials on 
        the fingers when rubbed.</p>
      <p><b>Sandy loam</b> <br>
        Soil in which the sand fraction is quite obvious, which moulds readily 
        when sufficient moist, but in most cases does not stick appreciably to 
        the fingers. Threads do not form easily.</p>
      <p><b>Loam</b> <br>
        Soil in which the fractions are so blended that it moulds readily when 
        sufficient moist, and sticks to the fingers to some extent. It can with 
        difficulty be moulded into threads but will not bend into a small ring.</p>
      <p><b>Silt loam</b><br>
        Soil that is moderately plastic without being very sticky and in which 
        the smooth, soapy feel of the silt is the main feature.</p>
      <p><b>Sandy clay loam</b><br>
        Soils containing sufficient clay to be distinctly sticky when moist, but 
        in which the sand fraction is an obvious feature.</p>
      <p><b>Clay loam</b><br>
        The soils is distinctly sticky when sufficiently moist, and the presence 
        of sand fraction can only be detected with care.</p>
      <p><b>Silty clay loam</b><br>
        This contains quite subordinate amounts of sand, but sufficient silt to 
        confer something of a smooth, soapy feel. It less sticky than silty clay 
        or clay loam.</p>
      <p><b>Silt</b><br>
        Soil in which the smooth, soapy feel of silt is dominant.</p>
      <p><b>Sandy clay</b><br>
        The soil is plastic and sticky when moistened sufficiently, but the sand 
        fraction is still an obvious feature. Clay and sand are dominant, and 
        the intermediate grades of silt and very fine sand are less apparent.</p>
      <p><b>Silty clay</b><br>
        Soil which is composed of almost very fine material, but in which the 
        smooth, soapy feel of the silt fraction modifies some extent the stickiness 
        of the clay.</p>
      <p><b>Clay</b><br>
        The soil is plastic and sticky when moistened sufficiently and gives a 
        polish surface on rubbing. When moist the soil can be rolled into threads, 
        and it is capable of being moulded into any shape and takes clear fingerprints.<br>
