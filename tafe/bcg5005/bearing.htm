      <a name="bear-soil"><h4>BEARING CAPACITY OF SOILS </h4></a>
      <p>The bearing capacity depends on the behaviour of the ground under a building and its interaction with the foundation. (Note that we make a distinction between footings and foundation. The term foundation may refer in some sources to footings.) The structural load of a building must be safety and economically transferred to the ground without unacceptable settlement.</p>

<p>A site investigation should be carried out to find out what type of structure it supports, its loading and the amount of movement that can be tolerated. For large building constructions a geotechnical site investigation according to AS 1726-1993 should be carried out. The requirements for the classification of a site and the design and construction of a footing system for a single dwelling house, townhouse or the like are found in AS 2870-1996 Residential slabs and footings-Construction.</p>
 

      <p>The <b><i>ultimate bearing capacity</i></b> for a typical foundation 
        base is the average vertical pressure on the ground that leads to failure 
        by shear, in other words the average contact pressure between the foundation 
        and the soil that will produce shear failure in the soil</p>
      
      <p>The <b><i>maximum safe bearing capacity</i></b> is the maximum value 
        of contact pressure to which the soil can be subjeted without risk of 
        shear failure. This is based entirely on the strength of the soil and 
        is the ultimate bearing capacity divided by an appropriate factor of safety.</p>
      <p>The <i><b>allowable bearing pressure</b></i> is according AS2870-1996 
        (Residential slabs and footings-Construction) the maximum bearing pressure 
        that can be sustained by the foundation from the proposed footing system 
        under service loads over the design range of soil moisture conditions. 
        Allowable bearing pressure shall be taken into consideration both the 
        site conditions and the ability of the building system to accommodate 
        settlement.<br>

<h4>Pressure distribution in soil </h4></a>
      <p>The pressure at depth h in a foundation is due to the weight of the building 
        and the self-weight of the soil above the depth h.<br>
      <p align="center"><img src="img/pressure.gif"> <br>
	  <br>
        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Figure 1</font> 
      <p>Figure 1 illustrates the theory of pressure distribution within the foundation. 
        The soil mass acts as an elastic medium. The circular footing load placed 
        on the soil mass will induce stresses within the soil. The circles, known 
        as bulbs of equal pressure, give an indication of the vertical pressure 
        below the foundation. As can be seen the pressure from the building load 
        decreases (see lower diagram in Figure 1) while the pressure from the 
        self-weight of the soil increases. From the bulb pressure you will get 
        some idea of the depth of soil affected by a footing. The width of a footing 
        determines at what depth the pressure from the building is reduced to 
        a neglected value. The pressure should be followed up to a depth of 2B 
        to 3B (B = footing width)<br>

      <p><img src="img/bearing-2.gif" align="left"><br> The bulb of pressure gives 
        an indication of the depth of soil affected by a footing. As can be seen 
        from Figure 2 it is important to investigate the site to a greater depth 
        for large footings. The depth at which the soil pressure need to be considered 
        depends on the size of the proposed footings. A 'plate loading test'* 
        can give misleading results if the proposed footing width is much lager 
        <br>
        than the plate size. Bore holes should <img src="img/40_3-5.gif" width="141" height="13"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Figure

        1 indicate vertical stresses at points below a footing.<br>

      <a name="plastic-failure"><h4>Plastic failure theory </h4></a>
      <p>A number of analyses have been carried out to find the ultimate bearing 
        capacity of the soil, qu, when the footing is at the surface as shown 
        in Figure 3.<br>

	 <p> The footing is moving downwards into the soil with no attendant rotation. The triangular wedge of soil immediately below the footing goes down with the footing and suffers no deformation, and creates an area of plastic flow  (I) which is prevented from moving outwards by the passive resistance of wedge (II).<br>
<p align="right">[ <a href="#top">top of page</a> ]</p>
      <a name="slip-circle"><h4>Slip circle theory </h4></a>
      <p>Another theory is the slip circle method as shown in Figure 4 (a). With 
        slip circle methods the foundation fails by rotating about some slip surface. 
        The slip surface is taken as the arc of a circle. Almost all foundation 
        failures showing rotational effects. The actual centre of rotation is 
        slightly above the base of the foundation and to one side of it as shown 
        in Figure 4 (b).</P>

<a name="liquid-p"><h3>Pressure on retaining structures</h3></a>	  
      
      <p><b>Liquid pressure</b>
      
<p>From diving experience we know that the pressure in a liquid (e.g. water) 
        becomes greater the deeper we dive. Consider the vertical surface A-B 
        of the wall in Figure 5. The cube situated at depth h exerts a pressure 
        of w &times h (kN) on all its surfaces. If one face of the cube is touching 
        the wall it will exert a pressure onto the wall. 
      <p>The density of water, <img src="img/rho.lc.gif" width="6" height="10"><sub><i>w</i></sub> 
        = 1000 kg/m&#179 = 1Mg/m&#179<br>
        The weight of 1000 kg mass is 1000 &times 9.81 = 9810 N (weight = mass 
        &times gravitational acceleration). Hence the unit weight of water, <img src="img/gamma.lc.gif" width="6" height="10"><sub><i>w</i></sub> 
        9.81 kN/m&#179. Instead of using the exact figure for the gravitational 
        acceleration we approximate this figure to 10 m/s&sup2;. This provides 
        a safety margin of approximately of 2% and on the other hand it suits 
        the decimal system and eases the calculations. <i>w</i> is the equivalent 
        density of water which in our case, will always be 10 kN/m&#179. In the 
        right diagram of Figure 1 the pressure at the surface is zero and at depth 
        h is <i>w</i> &times h. The average pressure of the 'wetted area' between 
        A and B is ½ w &times h (in kN per unit area).

      <p>There is some similarity between the calculation of the lateral pressure 
        in water and soil. However, it is apparent that pressures on vertical 
        surfaces from retained soils cannot be determined with the same accuracy 
        as with water. Soils vary in character and weight and behave quite differently 
        under these varying conditions. There are a number of soil pressure theories 
        for the calculation of soil pressure but only the Rankine's theory will 
        be dealt with.<br>
        As the density of soil can vary there will be a number of different unit

	  <p>Contemplate a smooth vertical wall supporting a mass of soil at rest 
        in which the lateral pressure on the wall is = K<sub>o</sub> <img src="img/gamma.lc.gif"> 
        h. If the wall is allowed to yield, i.e. move forward slightly, there 
        will be an immediate reduction in the value of lateral stress, but if 
        the wall is pushed slightly into the soil there will be an increase in 
        the value of the lateral pressure.<br>
        The minimum value is known as the <i><b>active earth pressure</b></i> 
        (E<sub>a</sub>), and the value equals K<sub>a</sub> &times <img src="img/gamma.lc.gif" width="6" height="10"> 
        h where K<sub>a</sub>) = the coefficient of active earth pressure.</p>
      <p>Rankine's theory states in general terms that the active earth pressure coefficient is:<br>
      <p align="center"><img src="img/bearing-eqat1.gif"></p>
      <p>The active earth pressure at a depth h (m) due to a level fill of soil 
        is therefore:<br>
      <P align="center"><img src="img/bearing-eqat2.gif" width="132" height="72"> 
      </p>
      <p>The passive earth pressure (E<sub>p</sub>), which equals K<sub>p</sub>&times<img src="img/gamma.lc.gif"> 
        h where Kp = the coefficient of passive earth pressure. <br>

	  <img src="img/example2.gif" align="left">A soil weighing 19 kN/m3 and having 
      an angle of repose <img src="phi.lc.gif"> of 34°, exerts a pressure on a 
      3.6 metre high vertical face of a wall.<br>
      <br>
      What is the resultasnt horizontal force per metre run of wall? <br>
      <p> <img src="img/bearing-eqat4.gif"><br>
<img src="img/40_3-5.gif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Figure 9</font>
      <p align="center">E<sub>a</sub> = 0.283 &times 19 &times 3.6 = 19.34 kN/m</p>

      <p>The total horizontal force from the raetained earth acting on the wall 
        surface is: </p>

      <div align="center">
<p> P = 19.34 &times ½ 3.6 = 34.84 kN </p>
      </div>
	  <p>It is of advantages to calculate the individual components, especially 
        if you need to know the E<sub>a</sub> figure. Compare this result with 
        the liquid pressure in Example 1. As you can see the force due to hydrostatic 
        (liquid) pressure is much less than the force due to earth pressure. This 
        results from the internal friction (<img src="phi.lc.gif" width="7" height="13"> 
        higher in sand than in clay) between the grains of the soil represented 
        by the Ka figure.
