      <p><b>What is a topographical map? </b><br>
        A topographical (topo means top) map is a map that depicts the shape of 
        the land seen from above. Topographical maps usually show contour lines 
        (elevation above sea level), lakes, rivers, roads, forested areas, urban 
        areas and the like.</p>

<b>What is a Geologic Map?</b><br>
              Geologic maps are not like other maps. They show geological features 
              like rock formation indicated by contact lines where different geologic 
              units are found next to each other.<br>
        <b>Faults</b> are great cracks or fractures on the earth crust. They occurs 
        when the ground is being stretched apart. Then, when the fault breaks, 
        it allows land to slip downwards as seen in <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Figure 
        1</font>. A further break of the fault produces shock waves that causes 
        the earth to shake and the result is an earthquakes.<br>
              
      <p>Geologic units that are bent and warped into rounded wavelike shapes 
        (crest <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Figure 2</font> 
        and trough <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Figure 3</font>) 
        are called <b>folds</b>.</p>

      <p>In the Learning Resource Center you find a variety of topographical and 
        geological maps. Study some of them and familiarise yourself with the 
        features that are of interest to building studies.</p>

    <td width=290><p><b>Topographic Maps</b><br>
Particular features can be recognised from the contour pattern, thus allowing a mental picture of the topography to be constructed. Studying the natural features such as rivers, lakes, marshes, cliffs and coasts, which are shown in topographic maps, helps to identify the hills and valleys which together form the topography of an area.

    <td width=300 valign=top><p><b>Geological Maps</b><br>
        Geological maps show the distribution of the superficial deposits (glacial 
        sands and gravel, boulder clay, alluvial sands and gravel etc.) and the 
        underlying solid rocks at the earth's surface. The distribution of the 
        solid rocks in a particular region is shown by means of geological boundaries, 
        drawn as lines in the geological map.</p>

<p>Geological maps are generally accompanied by vertical cross-sections, a stratigraphic column, a legend or key showing the structural symbols, ornament and colours used on the map, and a brief description of the geology.
Vertical cross-sections are drawn across the map to illustrate the geological structure of the rocks, as shown  in the opposite cross-section (Figure 6).</p></td></tr></table>
