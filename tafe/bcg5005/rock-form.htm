<h1>ROCK FORMATION </h1>
<p>Rock formations are created   millions of years of weathering and erosion by the elements such as heat, wind, rain&nbsp;and  occasional volcano.</p>
<p>Our planet is chock full of beautiful and bizarre rock formation. Access the 
link to some incredible pictures of <a href= "https://www.google.com.au/search?q=rock+formations+image&sa=X&biw=1280&bih=596&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&ei=gldHVOufHoL88QXymIHgAg&ved=0CBwQsAQ">rock formation</a></p>
<p>The  main&nbsp;<strong>types</strong> of&nbsp;<strong>rock</strong>&nbsp; and the differences among them have to do with how they are formed.&nbsp;
<h2>IGNEOUS ROCKS</h2>
      <p> Examples <img src="img/rarrow.gif" width="17" height="9"> 
        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><i><font size="2">Granite, 
        Basalt, Obsidian, Pumice</font></i></b></font><br>
  Igneous rocks are formed from molten magma or lava. The word, igneous means, 
  &quot;fire&quot;. All igneous rock starts deep in the earth as hot, molten magma.<br>
  If the magma cools and hardens inside the earth it is called &quot;intrusive&quot; 
  rock. These rocks cool slowly and have large crystals. When the magma comes 
  out of the earth's crust through a volcano, it is called &quot;extrusive&quot;. 
  It cools off quickly, and the crystals that form are very small.<br>
  Molten, or hot, liquid rock is called MAGMA when it is still inside the earth, 
  but once it comes out through a volcano it is called LAVA. </p>
<h2>SEDIMENTARY ROCKS</h2>
      <p> Examples <img src="img/rarrow.gif" width="17" height="9"> 
        <i><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Limestone , Jasper, 
        Gypsum, Conglomerate, Sandstone</font></b></i><br>
  Every minute of every day, rocks are being worn down by wind and rain. Tiny 
  grains of dirt, sand, mud and clay are worn off and washed into streams, rivers, 
  lakes and oceans. When these tiny bits of sand and dirt settle to the bottom 
  of the water, they are called sediment.<br>
  Minerals in the water and microscopic, or very tiny sea animals also get mixed 
  in with the dirt and sand to form the sediment. Every day more sediment piles 
  on top of what is already there.<br>
        After thousands and millions of years we end up with a really deep pile 
        of sediment. The weight and pressure from all the stuff on top turns the 
        sediment on the bottom into sedimentary rock!</p>
<h2>METAMORPHIC ROCKS</h2>
      <p> Example <img src="img/rarrow.gif" width="17" height="9"> 
        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i><b>Quartz, Amethyst, 
        Marble, Slate, Gneiss, Graphite</b></i></font><br>
  Metamorphic rocks are formed when other kinds of rocks are changed by great 
  heat and pressure inside the earth.<br>
  The word &quot;metamorphic&quot; means changed. Think of metamorphic rocks as 
  recycled rocks. When igneous, sedimentary or even metamorphic rocks get buried 
  deep beneath the surface of the earth, over millions of years the heat and pressure 
  inside the earth change them into something else.<br>
  Limestone can be changed to marble, sandstone can be changed into quartzite, 
  and shale can be changed to slate. It's just another example of how the earth 
  is constantly changing!<br>
</p>
<h2>TRANSPORTATION OF ROCKS</h2>
      <p>As rocks are broken down by chemical and physical forces, particles become 
        increasingly smaller. The particles are transported through rivers and 
        by wind. The three main sizes of soil include sand, silt, and clay. Soil 
        formation occurs due to the change in particle size, organic matter, and 
        the movement of elements and minerals. The four major influences on soil 
        are weathering, climate, land surface, and living organisms.</p>
