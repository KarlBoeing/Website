       <h3>Definition</h3></a>
      <p>Soil in broad terms for foundation engineering is the ground supporting 
        a structure. Soil is considered to be any loose sedimentary deposit, such 
        as gravel, sand, silt, clay or a mixture of these materials.</p>
      <p><b><font size="4">Granular soils (e.g. sand &amp; gravel)</font></b></p>
      <ul>
        <li> Granular soils (non-cohesive soils) e.g. sand<br>
          Sand and gravel have no shear strength. An apparent cohesion in sand can be noticed when water is present. Sand grains stick together due to negative pore pressure (building sandcastles is an example).
          Sand stand in slopes when wet but will not stand when dry or saturated.<br>
        <li>Strength, bearing capacity and slope stability all derived from internal 
          friction <img src="phi.lc.gif"> (Phi). <img src="phi.lc.gif"> for granular 
          soils (sand &amp; gravel) range from 30&deg; to 45&deg;. <img src="phi.lc.gif"> increases 
          due to grading, packing density and grain angularity.<br>
        <li>Courser grained soils are more permeable to water and, unless saturated, 
          may have very little water in their voids.<br>
        <li>If well consolidated and confined, they form a foundation that is 
          almost as stable as rock.<br>
        <li>If loosely consolidated or with high percentage of organic matter, 
          the site must be classified as a problem site.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Cohesive soils (e.g. silts and clays)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Cohesive soils have shear strength. It is possible to make a vertical 
          cut in silts and clays and it remain standing, unsupported, for some 
          time. This cannot be done in dry sand. In clay and silts, therefore, 
          some other factor must contribute to shear strength. This factor is 
          called cohesion. It results from the mutual attraction, which exist 
          between fine particles and tends to hold them together in a solid mass 
          without the application of external forces.<br>
        <li>Clay consist of very fine microscopic particles which hold water to 
          increase their volume, and release moisture to decrease their volume.<br>
        <li>Special precaution needs to be taken in the design of footings to 
          resist or avoid the forces caused by shrinking and swelling. </li>
      </ul>
      
<p>Soil consists of a mass of solids particles separated by spaces or voids. The voids of a soil are usually a mixture of air and water (soil is partially saturated). In certain circumstances the voids may be completely filled with water or air only. If only air is present the soil is dry and if only water is present the soil saturated. The Figure1 shows a cross-section through a granular soil.</p>

        through granular soil</font> </div>
      <p>In order to study the properties we will adopt the idealised 
        form of the diagram shown in Figure 1. The soil mass has a total volume 
        V, containing a volume of solid particles Vs and a volume of voids Vv. 
        In most cases the void volume exists of a mixture of water (Vw) and air 
        (Va).<br>
        The designation for the weight is W and the weight of water is Ww and 
        the weight of air is zero as shown on the right side in Figure 1 (b).<br>
