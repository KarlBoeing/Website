 <a name="sect1"><h3>Passive Fire Protection</h3></a>
      <p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style='font-family:Times-Roman'>There
        are many passive fire protection systems available to reduce the rise in temperature
        of steel members when exposed to elevated temperatures in a fire situation.
        Buchanan, (2001), states that fire resistance rating of a protected steel member
        although determined by calculations and depends on factors such as properties
        of protection material and fire temperature, there has to be some assurance of
        the fire resistance rating. This usually is achieved by full-scale testing of
        the structural system incorporating fire protection material, thus validating
        the effectiveness of the protection material used for specified fire duration
        in a real fire situation.</span></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span
style='font-family:Times-Roman'>Protection systems commonly used to increase
        the fire resistance rating of steel members are listed below and briefly
        explained (Buchanan, 2001).</span></font></p>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><span
style='font-family:Times-Roman'>Concrete encasement</span></b><span
style='font-family:Times-Roman'> involves pouring of concrete in the formwork
        housing the steel members. Reinforcement is provided to hold concrete in place
        during a fire situation and the required thickness of the concrete is
        determined from the design codes. A certain disadvantage of this form of
        protection is that it results in increased construction costs and bulky
        structural members.</span></font></p>
      <p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><span
style='font-family:Times-Roman'>Board systems</span></b><span style='font-family:
Times-Roman'> are mainly developed using calcium silicate or gypsum plaster. Calcium
        silicate boards are made of an inert material that is designed to remain in place
        during the duration of the fire. Gypsum boards have good insulating properties as
        well, and its resistance in fire is enhanced by the presence of water in the
        board which vaporise in elevated temperatures. This reaction provides a time
        delay when the board reaches about 100 </span><span style='font-family:Symbol'>°</span><span
style='font-family:Times-Roman'>C, but reduces the strength of the board after
        exposure to fire. Advantages of this form of protection system are that it is
        easy installation and finishing enhancing the aesthetic aspects of design.</span></font></p>
      <p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><span
style='font-family:Times-Roman'>Spray-on protection system</span></b><span
style='font-family:Times-Roman'> is usually the cheapest form of fire
        protection for steel members. Materials used for this method usually are
        cement-based with some form of glass or cellulosic fibrous reinforcing to hold
        the material together. The disadvantage of this method is that the application
        is a wet and messy one and the finished work is not aesthetically attractive.
        This form of fire protection is usually applied to beams rather than columns
        because it can be easily damaged due to soft material composition. Structural
        components such as bolts, steel brackets are likely to be protected with the
        spray-on protection system because other forms of protection might be
        difficult.</span></font></p>
      <p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><span
style='font-family:Times-Roman'>Intumescent paint</span></b><span
style='font-family:Times-Roman'> is a special paint that swells into a thick
        char when it is exposed to elevated temperatures enhancing the fire rating of
        the steel member beneath. The advantage of this protecting system is that the
        application is a quick process, is less bulky and the member can be simply
        painted over thus not deteriorating the appearance of the steelwork. The
        disadvantage being that it is more expensive than other systems such as board
        and spray-on systems.</span></font></p>
      <p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><span
style='font-family:Times-Roman'>Using timber boards</span></b><span
style='font-family:Times-Roman'> to encase structural members is another method
        of fire protecting system. The timber used has to be well seasoned and a
        thermosetting adhesive are usually used to firmly fix the boarding over the
        structural members.</span></font></p>
      <p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><span
style='font-family:Times-Roman'>Concrete filling</span></b><span
style='font-family:Times-Roman'> is mainly used for hollow steel sections to
        improve their fire performance. An advantage of the system is that external
        protection is not required and can increase the load bearing capacity of that
        member. The infill concrete can be reinforced or be in the form of plain
        concrete.</span></font></p>
      <p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><span
style='font-family:Times-Roman'>Water filling system</span></b><span
style='font-family:Times-Roman'> works in a similar principle to concrete
        filling where hollow steel sections are filled with water. The in filled water
        has some additives added in order to prevent corrosion. This form of protection
        requires plumbing systems to ensure water will flow in the members by
        convection and excessive pressure is not developed by heated water. It is only
        used in special structures and is considered expensive when compared with other
        systems.</span></font></p>

style='font-family:Times-Roman'>Flame shields</span></b><span style='font-family:

        by flames exiting through the window openings. Usually architectural claddings
        are installed to form the shields</span></font></p>
