      <h2 align="center">Assignment Topics</h2>
<p>Students need to investigate aspects of design and construction having, primarily, 
  to do with the refurbishing, restoration, and renovation of older <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Perth</st1:City></st1:place> buildings. Students 
  can select a topic from the list below or alternatively select a specific topic 
  that is of special interest to you but isn't listed. However, your own selected 
  topic needs the approval of the lecturer.</p>
  It may not be easy to get sufficient information for your assignment topic. 
        It will take a lot of phone calls and running around to find out whether 
        you get adequate information to complete your topic. Keep in mind that 
        contacts and/or documents, required for your assignment, from architects, 
        contractors, builders, owners or/and construction managers often are hard 
        to get. 
		<div style="line-height:8pt"><br></div>
        Before you submit your synopsis make sure you selected a topic for which 
        you can gather adequate information to complete the task. Choosing a different 
        topic at a later stage will create a severe setback and you may not be 
        able to finish the module. Please take time to do your topic-research 
        thoroughly. <div style="line-height:8pt"><br></div>

      Student learning is assessed by means of research documentation, report 
      writing (assignment) and oral presentation. Throughout the unit an emphasis 
      is placed on using alternative construction methods and resolving construction 
      &amp; site problems which can commonly occur with building materials used 
      in commercial and industrial building.
