        <b>Examinations</b></p>

 
<p><b>Assignment Submission Requirements</b></p>
      <p>An assignment submission form, including <span lang=EN-US><b>cover page</b> 
        with a </span><a href="../general/assignment/ass-write.htm">plagiarism declaration</a> 
        is required for each assignment. Assignments to be handed in as loose 
        paper collection stapled together at the top left corner. The assignment 
        should be presented as a technical report. <b><i>It must consist of a 
        cover page, table of contents, and should have an introduction, a body, 
        a conclusion or recommendation, and a references page.</i></b></p>
<p>Do not forget to <b>number</b> the pages. Any embellishment, fancy fonts and borders 
  should be avoided. (Your report is a technical document and not a selling brochure that 
  needs to catch the attention of customer.)</p>
      <p>Include photos, diagrams sketches, tables etc., and do not forget to refer 
        to them in your text. </p>
<p>Do your research, and then write up a draft. Before you write your final assignment, 
  you may discuss your draft with your lecturer to clear up any problems you may 
  have encountered. Make sure your final assignment is ready by the <b><i>due 
  date.</i></b></p>
<p>If you have difficulties or are unfamiliar with report writing, contact the 
  Learning Resource Centre (LRC) where you will find numerous textbooks about 
  report writing.</p>
      <p>To complete the subject assessment satisfactorily two assignments and 
        two presentations <span lang=EN-US> are required.  </span></p>
<p><b><span lang=EN-US>Oral presentation requirements</span></b><span lang=EN-US></span></p>
      <p><span lang=EN-US>It is important to plan your presentation. Approach 
        your lecturer if you need some guidance on this matter. The most difficult 
        part is keeping your presentation within the time limit of 10 minutes. 
        Refer to ‘<i><a href="../general/oral-present.htm">Oral 
        Presentation</a>’</i>.</span></p>
<p><b>Assessments</b><b><span lang=EN-US></span></b></p>
      <p>Each <span lang=EN-US>of the two </span>assignment<span
lang=EN-US>s</span> and oral presentations will count <b>25%</b> and <b>25%</b> 
        respectively towards your final marks. A pass mark of <b>60%</b> for each 
        assignment and <b>50%</b> for each of the oral presentation is required. 
        Assignments should be submitted and the oral presentation <span
lang=EN-US>must be given </span>on the <b>due date.</b> <span lang=EN-US>Students 
        who do not turn up and fail to give their talk on the stipulated day cannot 
        complete this subject and <b>need to re-enroll</b>. </span>Assignments 
        submitted up to a week later than the due date will receive a reduction 
        in marks (<b>5% for each day</b>). Assignments will not be accepted later 
        than seven (7) days late. Therefore make sure you submit your assignment 
        on the date when it is <b><i>due</i></b>. <span lang=EN-US>All students 
        must turn up for the presentation</span><b><i>.</i></b><span lang=EN-US> 
        Students who are not present at oral presentations lose <b>5&nbsp;marks.</b></span></p>
