        Building Technology 1</b></font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Below are some suggested topics. However, you are encouraged 
        to research a topic that isn't listed but is of special interest to you. 
        The emphasis should be placed on environmentally responsible construction 
        practices that utilise sustainable and efficient use of resources. Any 
        of the topics, whether selected from the list or your own selection, needs 
        my approval and the scope of your work needs to be discussed with me.
