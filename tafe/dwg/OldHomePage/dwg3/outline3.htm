      Students need to investigate wide-spanning 
      steel structures and prepare a <a href="JournalRequirements.htm" target="_blank">journal</a> 
      with records of site visit(s) describing their observations covering types 
      of structure (<i>portal frames (BHP-sections) as an alternatively lattice 
      girders or space-frames etc.</i>); stability issues; roof/wall claddings; 
      connections types; etc.). Pictorial &amp; orthographic sketches of specific 
      details must be included. The journal will assist students in the preparation 
      of the working drawings. Journals must be submitted in Week 5. Any issue 
      raised during your investigation will be discussed in class. Refer to <a href="prog3-02.htm" target=_blank>program</a> 
      and assessment for tests, assignments and examination.
