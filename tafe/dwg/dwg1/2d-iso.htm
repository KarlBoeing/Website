      <p>This paragraph is concerned with the production of drawings. Specifications 
        and working drawings convey to the contractor/builder the necessary information 
        to erect and complete a structure. Drawings will vary from company to 
        company but the following approach is used for this subject: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Identify and analyse the assignment instruction to ensure you have 
          a complete view of the scope of work.
        <li>If you have any question clarify the issues with your lecturer.
        <li>Think of possible solutions to all aspects of your assignment and 
          make, if necessary, freehand multi-view and/or pictorial sketches for 
          clarification.
        <li>You should then discuss your ideas with your lecturer.
        <li>If you have a clear understanding of the scope of work you may then 
          prepare your draft sketches as outlined below. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>In Builders Working Drawing you learn how to create orthographic drawing 
        as well as pictorial drawings.</p>
      <p align="center"><a name="sect1"><b><font size="4">Orthographic projections</font></b></a></p>
      <p align="left"><b>First and third angle projection</b>
      <p align="left">This is a graphical method used in engineering drawings. 
        The word <b>orthographic</b> is derived from the Greek words <b>orthos</b>-<i>straight, 
        rectangular</i> and <b>graphos</b>-<i>written, drawn</i>. A drawing of 
        a structure or part thereof can be drawn using the following projection 
        methods:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        (a) orthogonal&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        (b) oblique and/or &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) 
        perspective
      <p align="center">There are two methods of drawing <b>orthographic</b> projections:<br>
        1) first angle projection and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) third angle 
        projection</p>
      <p> They are based on right angle planes with defined separate spaces , 
        or quadrants. Each quadrant could obtain an object to be presented. However, 
        only two are commonly used, the first and the third as shown in Figure 
        1.</p>
      <div align="left"><img src="angle-projection-s.gif" align="left">Both systems 
        of projection are approved internationally and the system used is clearly 
        indicated on all engineering drawings with the following illustrations: <br>

      <p align="left">In which projection architectural and builders working drawings 
        are represented is generally insignificant. Nearly all of those drawings 
        do not indicate in which projection they are drawn and it really does 
        not matter. However, it is important that you understand the basic principles 
        of orthographic projection and be able to construct orthographic views 
        of objects.

      <p>In Drawing 1 you will draw a number of different objects. The views should 
        always be aligned with each other allowing sufficient space between the 
        views for dimensions (see Step 1 - Figure 6). Lines that cannot be seen 
        in a specific view are hidden and shown as dashed lines.</p>

      <p><a name="sect3"><b>Working drawings for buildings</b></a></p>
      <p>Orthographic <i>building/construction drawings</i> are a two dimensional 
        representation of a structure. They are drawn in various scales depending 
        on the detail and content required and offer the following advantages 
        compared with other systems:
        </p>
      <ol type=a>
        <li>It's usually the simplest and quickest method of giving an accurate 
          representation of an object.</li>
        <li>Only those views that are essential need to be drawn.</li>
        <li>Dimensioning is relatively easy.</li>
        <li>Sectional and part views are easier to construct.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The only disadvantage of this method is that some training is necessary 
        before you can draw or read a drawing. Sometimes it's easier to draw the 
        object in perspective view (pictorial view), especially for clients who 
        have difficulties interpreting orthographic drawings. </p>
      <p> Building construction drawings usually show the following views:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Plan view (Floor-plan) </li>
        <li>Elevations (faces of the building) </li>
        <li> Cross-Sections </li>
        <li>Details</li>
      </ul>
      For a building application to council the following plans are required:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) 
      Site plan,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) floor plan(s),&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c)elevations,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) 
      Sections<br>
      All your drawings must be fully dimensioned to enable builders to construct 
      and build the drawn object.
      <p>To draw a complete set of plan for a building do the following:
      <ul>
        <li>&nbsp;First draw a plan-view in pencil on any paper <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(<font color="#FF0000">Plan 
          1</font>)</font>
        <li>&nbsp;Then draw the section <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FF0000">(Plan 
          2)</font> on another piece of paper. Use <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FF0000">Plan 
          1</font> to extend the lines and add &nbsp;all vertical elements that 
          cannot be shown in a plan-view to finish the Section.
        <li>&nbsp;Use Floor plan <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FF0000">(Plan 
          1)</font> and the rearranged Section <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FF0000">(Plan 
          2)</font> to draw the Elevation <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FF0000">(Plan 
          3)</font> as &nbsp;shown below.
        <li>&nbsp;Keep section <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Plan 
          2)</font> and rotate<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Plan1</font> 90&deg; (clockwise or anticlockwise) and draw another &nbsp;elevation.
        <li>&nbsp;Rotate <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Plan1</font> again 90&deg; to complete the next elevation.</li>
        <li>Use the same procedure to complete all elevations. </li>

          <center>
            Figure 7
          </center>
          </font><br>
        <li>&nbsp;Having finished drawing all required items you can now arrange 
          all items and place them on your &nbsp;board to fit the designated paper 
          size. Then overlay the transparency paper and trace all views.
      </ul>
      <p>All drawings, whether section, details, pictorial views etc. that need 
        to be produced in ink on transparency paper draw first the item on any 
        paper and then trace it onto the transparency paper. This allows you to 
        place the items most appropriately on your designated sheet avoiding running 
        out of space or overcrowding.

      </DIV>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><a name="sect4"><b>Type of lines</b></a><br>
        If all lines on a drawing are of the same thickness the drawing may not 
        be clear or difficult to interpret. However, if the salient features are 
        shown in thick lines and others in thin lines the drawing is easier to 
        read and interpret. To ensure uniformity of line types the Australian 
        and international standards should be used [see ARCHITECTURAL DRAWING 
        Standards &amp; Conventions (K J Holtom)]. <br>
        The most common sizes for pens are 0.7, 0.5, 0.35 and 0.25 mm. The minimum 
        requirements is to have two disposable pens, sizes 0.4 and 0.2 mm. (Disposable 
        Rotring pens are not recommended because of slow drying.)<br>
        If you need to draw a thicker line, the <b>back-line</b> technique can 
        be used. This line is produced by drawing two (2) lines at approximately 
        line distance apart (with a 0.4 mm pen a 0.7 mm line thickness can be 
        produced).<br>
        <b>Pencil lines</b> should be sharp, dense and uniform on drawings that 
        are not produced in ink. Make sure their is a visible contrast between 
        the thickness of thick, medium and thin lines. This can be achieved by 
        using a softer grade for thick lines than that used for the other line 
        thickness. As a guide use for construction and dimension lines a 2H-lead, 
        for all other thin lines a H-lead and for thick lines B- or HB-&nbsp;lead. 
        Smudging of pencil drawings can be avoided if you cover the finish portion 
        of the drawing with a piece of paper.</p>
      <p><a name="sect5"><b>Sketching techniques</b></a><br>
        Most students may not have to produce complete working drawings in their 
        working environment. However, it will be beneficial if you develop good 
        freehand sketching skills. The ability to create detailed views with a 
        pencil on a piece of paper is extremely important for supervisors or builders. <br>
        All details are composed of lines: horizontal, vertical, angular, circular 
        or elliptical. The procedure below describes the movement of your hand 
        for sketching lines. A bit of practice is needed to develop the skill 
        to produce freehand sketches.<br>
        <img src="freehand.gif"><br>
      
     <p align="center"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

          <p align="right"> <a id="top"></a>[ <a href="#top">top</a> ]</p>
   
      <p><a name="sect6"><b>Lettering</b></a> <br>
      </p>
      <p>To "letter" a drawing or sketch in a neat and consistent style is very 
        important. Bad lettering will spoil your drawing. Use single stroke vertical 
        or sloping letters on your drawing.<br>
        For all letters we use only upper case. Normal lettering is made 3 mm 
        high with 2 mm line spacing and titles 5 mm high with 3 mm line spacing. 
        Good lettering depends on the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Uniformity of shape <font size="2">(refer to ARCHITECTURAL DRAWING 
          Standards &amp; Conventions (K J Holtom)</font><br>
        <li>Uniformity of style <font size="2">(no mixed style on the same drawing) </font>
        <li>Uniformity of size<font size="2"> (letter touching upper & lower guide 
          lines) </font>
        <li>Uniformity of line thickness <font size="2">(all strokes & curves 
          must have the same line thickness)</font>
        <li>Uniformity of slope <font size="2">(use vertical or sloping guide 
          lines to keep characters upright or sloping)</font>
        <li>Uniformity of spacing <font size="2">(keep white areas between letters 
          equal and the space between words the same)</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p>To produce good lettering the position of your hand is important. Use 
        the following guidelines as a basis:
      <ul>
        <li>Your forearm should rest on the drawing board </li>
        <li>Your index finger should be kept as straight as possible along the 
          pencil. This will help to avoid tension in the hand. </li>
        <li>Your forearm should be at an angle of 75-80° with the line of lettering. </li>
        <li>All strokes should where possible be made from top to bottom and from 
          right to left.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Pencil lettering</b><br>
        The most important aspect of pencil lettering is making a uniform dense 
        black line by applying adequate pressure on the pencil. This depends on 
        selecting a pencil that has the proper hardness. The selection of the 
        grade (B, HB or H) depends on the surface of your drawing paper. Try the 
        different leads for best result!<br>
      </p>
      <p><b>Ink lettering </b><br>
        In ink lettering the thickness depends on the pen used and not on the 
        pressure applied. If you use tubular pens you should hold them perpendicular 
        to the paper to avoid varying line thickness.<br>
