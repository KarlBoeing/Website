<p><b>Pictorial views  (3D views)</b> </p>
      <p>An object can be shown three different views. </p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Isometric projection</b> is a method of portraying, on a single 
          view, a three-dimensional picture. It can be use for making rough sketches 
          on site to clarify an issue. The angle between the principal axes is 
          120&deg;. The scale ratio for isometric drawings is the same for each 
          principal axis (Y:Z:X = 1:1:1) as can be seen in Figure 2 (a).
          <p><b>Selection of axises</b></p>
	  <p>The selection of the principal axis of an isometric view is very important. 
        Most objects that you'll draw are put in a rectangular box. A rectangular box 
        has eight corners which could be used as the principal axis for your isometric 
        sketch as shown below. View <b>(a)</b> is the preferred view as it reveals 
        more detail than all the others.</p>
      <div align="center"><img src="iso-views.gif">
        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Figure 1</font><br><br> 
		</div>   </li>
       <p>Consider the item or detail that you need to draw carefully and then 
        select the best option for the view.</p>
      <div align="right"><a href="#top"> [top of page]</a></div><br>
<li><b><a name=op>Oblique projection</a></b>. - There are two types of oblique projection:<br> 
          1) Cavalier <font size="-1">(angle between projectors and projection plane is 45<em>&deg;</em>. Perpendicular faces are projected at full scale)</font><br>
This projection will not be used.            
          <br>
        2) Cabinet <font size="-1">(angle between projectors and projection plane is 45°. Perpendicular faces are projected at 50% scale)</font> <br>
         In both projection, the main view is drawn 
          as an orthographic projection and the side views are represented on 
          inclined planes. The angle between the orthogonal and inclined plane 
          is 45&deg;)</font>. The scale ratio for oblique drawings is the same for two 
          principal axis and half for the inclined plane (Y:Z:X = 1:1:0.5) as 
          can be seen in Figure 2 (b). <br>
          An <b>alternative</b> of the oblique projection is to change the principal 
          axis, refer to Figure 2 (c). This method gives an more appropriate view 
          of the object to be drawn.<br>
          Great care should be taken when you select a viewing direction in oblique 
          view. The best viewing direction is when the important details are shown 
          in the face with the principal axis Y:Z:X = 1:1:0.67. Use the view that shows all details clearly.</li>

            isometric &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            (b) oblique&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
            (c) oblique alternative &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            <center><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Figure 2</font></center> 
   <p>In oblique projections the main view is drawn as an orthographic projection and the two other 
        side views are shown on an inclined plane. The angle of inclination is 
        45&deg; to the horizontal and all measurements on the two oblique planes 
        are halved (see Figure 3 (a). Oblique drawings can result in distortion. 
        Sometimes a better option is to use the oblique alternative view as shown 
        in Figure 3 (b).</p>

          <li><b><a name=pd>Perspective Drawings</a></b><br>
            A perspective drawing is similar to a photograph: as the lines of an 
            object recede toward the <img src="persective.gif" align="left">back, 
            they appear to converge or become closer together. The advantage of 
            a perspective drawing over scale and full-size drawings is that the 
            object looks more like what our eyes perceive if we viewed the actual 
            object. That is, a three-dimensional perspective is provided. These 
            drawings are very difficult to construct and not part of this course.        </p> </li>
      </ol>
     <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><div style="text-indent:180px">Figure 4</div></font>
     <p>However, nowadays the Computer Aided Drafting packages (CAD) have 
            3-D facilities build in and the skill to draw in perspective mode 
            is of no great importance in building and engineering drawing anymore.</p>

	  <p><b><a name=c>Circles in isometric projections</a></b></p>
      <p>A circle drawn in isometric view is represented as an ellipse. Use the 
        ordinates constructed on an orthogonal view and transfer them to the isometric 
        view. Having established some points of the curve use the best fitted 
        curve to connect the points either freehand or with a French curve. This 
        principle is shown in Figure 2 below.</p>
