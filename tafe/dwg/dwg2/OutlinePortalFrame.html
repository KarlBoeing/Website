    <td colspan=2>General drawing requirements (orthographic and pictorial views, 
      set of drawing for council approval, working drawings and details). The 
      main emphasis is place on the construction of a steel-framed factory and 
      office complex. Refer to <a href="AssessRequirements.htm" target=_blank>project 
      details</a> for more information.<br>
      Students need to investigate wide-spanning 
      steel structures and prepare a <a href="JournalRequirements.htm" target="_blank">journal</a> 
      with records of site visit(s) describing their observations covering types 
      of structure (<i>portal frames (BHP-sections) as an alternatively lattice 
      girders or space-frames etc.</i>); stability issues; roof/wall claddings; 
      connections types; etc.). Pictorial &amp; orthographic sketches of specific 
      details must be included. The journal will assist students in the preparation 
      of the working drawings. Journals must be submitted in Week 5. Any issue 
      raised during your investigation will be discussed in class. Refer to <a href="prog3-02.htm" target=_blank>program</a> 
      and assessment for tests, assignments and examination.<br>

        5. <b>Assessment 5</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;(Examination detail drawing) Week 18<br>
        <br>
        A pass in each of the five (5) elements of Assessment is required to pass 
        the Subject.<br>
      If a pass is not achieved in any of Assignments 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 at first attempt, 
      an 'H' grade is to be applied. The student must submit or sit tests for 
      second attempt to clear the 'H' grade. A 'H' grade for Assignment 1 to 4 
      must be cleared within <b>one Week</b> after your due date of that particular 
      submission. If the student does not PASS the second attempt within the stipulated 
      Resubmission/re-sit time frame an 'R' grade is to be applied.
