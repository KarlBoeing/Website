      <p>As part of your assessments you must produce Working Drawings for a fabrication 
        workshop with an attached two storey office building. Your research and 
        journal records as well as the lecturer will help you to accomplish the 
        work. <br>
        The scope of work for Assignment 3 and 4 is outlined below. </p>

      <p>It is the responsibility of the student to investigate a similar structure 
        and keep record of all relevant issues in a journal. Students must be 
        familiar with matters associated with this kind of construction when attempting 
        Assignment 3 &amp; 4. Team work is an important part of this unit. Clarify 
        with your lecturer which details you need to draw/sketch. An active participation 
        in class discussion is part of your assessment. </p>
      <p>Common issues should be discussed among students and each student has 
        to search for a solution to his/her design proposal. Your ideas and proposals 
        will discuss and clarify in class as well as any subject matter that you 
        may raise. An active participation in class discussion is part of your 
        assessment. </p>
