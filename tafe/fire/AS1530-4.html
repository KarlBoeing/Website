     The measurement of heat release rate (HRR) and smoke
        production rate (SPR) are direct indicators of the fire hazard. The growth of
        the HRR enables a lining material to be classified with respect to time based
        on if or when flashover occurs. The measurements of gas species, percentage of
        flame spread area over the lining surface, and compartment temperatures and
        smoke layer height, are compared to confirm that the conditions generated are
        consistent with the primary parameters of HRR and SPR and accurately reflect
        the fire hazard<br><br>
     <b>3.5 Roof: Concession</b><br>
     A roof need not comply with Table 3 if its covering is
        non-combustible and the building—<br>
       
     (a)        has a sprinkler
        system complying with Specification E1.5 installed throughout; or<br>
        (b)        has a rise in storeys
        of 3 or less; or<br>
        (c)        is of Class 2 or 3;

        (d)        has an effective height of not more than

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;less than
        60&nbsp;minutes.<br><br>
     <b>Key Factors for Time-Equivalent Analysis<br>
      </b><br>
     When a fire reaches a stage where there is full involvement
        of the combustibles within a compartment (known as flashover), the intensity of
        the heat in the hot smoke layer will cause glazing and non-fire resisting
        facades to fail, allowing hot gases to escape (see Figure below).<br>
     <img src="Week 3-5-HO-ppt_files/image010-500.jpg" width="500" height="221" align=center hspace=50><br>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
      </font>
     Similarly, openings to atria will also allow hot gases to
        escape. The temperatures reached in a compartment and the duration of a fire
        depend on natural ventilation through openings to atria and glazing or non-fire
        resisting facades that fail in a fire. <br>
