style='font-family:Arial;'>Selection of appropriate building material</span></b></p>
      <p>The selection of building materials greatly
        impacts the sustainability of a project. By choosing building materials wisely,
        such as considering the complete life cycle of the materials, a builder can
        reduce the impact of the project on the environment. Careful material selection can minimise
        the depletion of resources, including raw materials, such as wood and metals,
        as well as energy and water used in the manufacturing process. It also can
        allow for efficient reuse or recycling of materials and building components if
        a building or facility is to be deconstructed or demolished. Finally, building
        materials choices may alleviate environmental impacts created by the manufacturing
        process.</p>
      <p>The selection of building materials should
        have due regard to the embodied energy of the product and its environmental
        impact.</p>
      <p>The following questions may be
        used to determine the selection of building material:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What material property (eg strength, durability,
          density, combustibility etc),is required for construction type </li>
        <li>Does the material and construction technique
          provide safety against natural hazards (eg fire, heavy rain, cyclones,
          earthquake etc)?</li>
        <li>Is the material produced locally, or is it
          partially or entirely imported?</li>
        <li>What are the costs of the material (can it be
          produced at lower costs on the building site)?</li>
        <li>Where has it been produced (transport costs!)?</li>
        <li>Is the material made with recycled content?</li>
        <li>Is the material suitable for the climate condition</li>
        <li>Has the material a lifespan equivalent to the projected life of the
          building.</li>      </ul>

        <li>Encourage development of new, efficient, low impact materials and
          applications by creating demand.</li>

      <p>Someone who is involved in materials procurement is
        responsible for buying goods (eg materials needed for the building project).Any
        business organisation that uses, or sells products will generally have a
        materials procurement department. </p>
      <p>Often a materials procurement manager will be in
        charge of this division, although several different individuals may be needed.
        This person will meet with potential providers of goods and factor in any
        number of things when making a decision to buy. The goods a company purchases
        and then resells to consumers can make all the difference between success and
        failure in the marketplace.</p>
      <p>Another important factor in material procurement proceedings is the negotiation of a price.</p>
      <p>As a manager or executive in your company’s purchasing or materials
        management organisation, you face many challenges. Overall, you are being asked
        to find ways to cut costs, shorten cycle times, improve supply chain partner
        relationships and generally do more with less.</p>

        Cycle Assessment (LCA*)</b></p>
      <p>To understand and
        mitigate the environmental impact of buildings and occupying houses, many
        companies are already using a LCA methodology to more accurately compare the
        advantages and disadvantages of different building materials.</p>
      <p class="style4">* LCA is a method that can be used to quantify
        and assess the environmental impact of any product. LCA provides a way to
        quantify &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the relative importance of building use compared to the rest of the
      building’s life cycle.</p>

      <h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a id="top"></a><a name="3">3. Storage
        of material</a></h2>
      <p>Handling and storing materials involves diverse operations
        such as hoisting tons of steel with a crane, driving a truck loaded with
        concrete blocks, manually carrying bags and material, and stacking drums,
        barrels, kegs, lumber, or loose bricks.</p>
      <p>The efficient handling and storing of materials is vital to
        industry. Workers frequently name the weight and bulkiness of objects being
        lifted as major contributing factors to their injuries and back injuries
        accounted for more than 20 percent of all occupational illnesses. General
        safety principles can help reduce workplace accidents and injuries (see Code of
        Practice Manual Handling).</p>
      <p>One of the best things you can do with your construction
        site is store materials properly. Although it would be nice to get materials,
        and use them same day, during the <span class=klink>construction</span><span
style='color:black'> process, you are inevitably
        going to have to store some of your materials. You are going to want to ensure
        that they are safe from theft, weather, etc. Otherwise, the cost of building is
        going to greatly increase. </span></p>
      <p>So what can you do to store materials, and cut replacement costs? </p>
      <p>Coordinate the delivery of materials when it will be used. If that can be
        done successfully the materials won't be on site for very long before it's used.
        In this case there is a smaller chance of &quot;being misplaced&quot; or
        walking away, and a lesser chance of being damaged. Coordinating such
        deliveries is especially important because the storage of materials for very
        long will increase the costs.</p>
      <p>Materials not delivered on schedule must
        be stored at a safe place. This can be a lockable storage container. The
        container should be positioned at an appropriate location on site. Material
        stored in a shed is harder to steal, and protected it until it is going to be
        used.</p>
      <p>When it comes to storing materials, it
        is important to have them near where they will be used. Store things such as
        bricks and blocks on pallets placed nearby the place of use. </span></p>
      <p>The following points should be
        considered:</span> </p>
      <p class="style2" style='line-height:
normal;text-autospace:none'><b>Material Delivery Practices</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Keep an accurate, up-to-date inventory of material
          delivered and stored onsite.</li>
        <li>Employees and subcontractors should be trained on
          the proper material delivery and storage practices.</li>
        <li>Arrange for employees trained in emergency spill
          cleanup procedures to be present when dangerous materials or liquid chemicals
          are unloaded.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="style2" style='
line-height:normal;span style='color:black;'><strong>Storage on site</span></b></strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Site supervisors must provide adequate
          facilities for storage and handling of building materials.</span></li>
        <li>Construction site areas should be designated for
          material delivery and storage.</li>
        <li>Temporary storage area should be located away from
          vehicular traffic.</li>
        <li>Material delivery and storage areas should be
          located near the construction entrances,</li>
        <li>Where it is necessary, place erodible
          material on a hard surface.</span></li>
        <li>Don't place the material near a rubbish
          skip.</span></li>
        <li>Materials must not be stored/retained
          on a road reserve without first obtaining permission from the Council).</span></li>
        <li>Material placed on the road reserve
          must not block traffic or cause a safety problem.</span></li>
        <li>Storage of reactive, ignitable, or flammable
          liquids must comply with the fire codes.</li>
        <li>Hazardous materials storage onsite should be
          minimized. </li>
        <li>Prevent, reduce, or eliminate the discharge of
          pollutants from material delivery and storage to the stormwater system,</li>
        <li>During the rainy season, consider storing materials
          in a covered area.</li>
        <li>Don't store chemicals, drums, or bagged materials
          directly on the ground.</li>
        <li>Contain and clean up any spill immediately.</li>
        <li>Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) should be
          supplied for all hazardous materials stored,</li>
      </ul>
