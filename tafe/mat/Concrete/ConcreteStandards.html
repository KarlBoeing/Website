<span class="style5">There are a wide variety of Australian Standards® and handbooks for different types of concrete and cement products. The publications we supply cover structural design, manufacturing requirements and laboratory tests for different grades of concrete and cementitous materials. Information on publications covering these topics is included below.</span>
<div class="style5" style="line-height:4px"><br /></div>
<span class="style5">Australian Standards® and handbooks relating to concrete define requirements for precast and reinforced concrete products. Precast concrete products are not installed with reinforcing steels. Alternatively, reinforced concrete structures are supplied with reinforcing steels. Reinforcing steels used with concrete structures should be tested to <span class="style2">AS/NZS 4671:2001 'Steel reinforcing materials'</span> Definitions for different types of concrete and related products are included in<span class="style2"> HB 50-2004 'Glossary of building terms'
</span></span>
<div class="style5" style="line-height:4px"><br /></div>
<h3 class="style5">Concrete - Design Publications</h3>
<span class="style5">Concrete structures manufactured from precast and reinforced concrete materials should conform to the design requirements of <span class="style2">AS 3600-2009 'Concrete structures'</span> . The 2001 edition of AS 3600 is still referenced in the 2009 edition of the Building Code of Australia.</span>
<div class="style5" style="line-height:4px"><br /></div>
<span class="style5">A summary of recommended exposure classifications for concrete structures located in different regions is included in Section 4.3 of AS 3600-2009 . This Standard does not cover requirements for concrete used to build maritime structures. These details are included in<span class="style2"> AS 4997-2005 'Guidelines for the design of maritime structures'</span></span>
<div class="style5" style="line-height:4px"><br /></div>
<span class="style5">There are also 3 handbooks providing further details on this Standard:</span>
<div class="style5" style="line-height:4px"><br /></div>

<li class="style3"><em>HB 64-2002 'Guide to concrete construction'</em></li>

<li class="style3"><em>HB 71-2002 'Reinforced concrete design in accordance with AS 3600-2001'</em></li>

<li class="style3"><em>NP:PCH-2009 'Precast Concrete Handbook'</em></li>
<div class="style5" style="line-height:4px"><br /></div>
<span class="style5">Linear, angular, profile and general building tolerances for materials used to manufacture precast concrete structures is included in Chapter 4 of NP:PCH-2009 Tolerances for reinforced concrete structures are included in AS 3600-2001</span>
<div class="style5" style="line-height:4px"><br /></div>
<h3 class="style5">Concrete - Manufacturing Standards and Laboratory Tests</h3>
<span class="style5">The Australian manufacturing Standard for all types of concrete (e.g. normal-class, special-class, hardened concrete and plastic concrete is <span class="style6"><em>AS 1379-2007 'Specification and supply of concrete'</em></span> . There is also a commentary to this Standard. The document number for the commentary is <span class="style6"><em>AS 1379 Supp 1-2008</em></span>. Table 1 in AS 1379-2007 lists recommended comprehensive strength levels for different grades of concrete. Information on recommended sampling plans and production control procedures for manufacturing concrete are outlined in Section 6 of the Standard. Sampling procedures used to manufacture concrete are also outlined in <span class="style6"><em>AS 1012.1-1993 'Methods of testing concrete - Sampling of fresh concrete'
</em>.</span></span>
<div class="style5" style="line-height:4px"><br /></div>
<span class="style5">Materials used to manufacture concrete structures should conform to structural adequacy, integrity and insulation fire resistance tests. These types of tests should be completed by following methods outlined in AS 1530.4-2005 'Methods for fire tests on building materials, components and structures - Fire-resistance test of elements of building construction'. Figures providing details on recommended structural adequacy levels for beams and a table listing fire insulation levels for concrete slabs are included in Section 5 of AS 3600-2001</span>
<div class="style5" style="line-height:4px"><br /></div>
<span class="style5">Chemical admixtures added to concrete should be tested to<span class="style6"><em> AS 1478.1-2000 'Chemical admixtures for concrete, mortar and grout - Admixtures for concrete'</em></span> .</span>
<div class="style5" style="line-height:4px"><br /></div>

<p class="style5">Laboratory tests for the grades of concrete outlined in AS 1379-2007 are covered by the AS 1012 series of test methods. Curing tests for concrete specimens are covered by AS 1012.1-1993 and <span class="style6"><em>AS 1012.8.2-2000 'Methods of testing concrete - Method of making and curing concrete'</em></span>. Compressive tests for cylinders used to manufacture concrete are completed by following the methods outlined in <span class="style6"><em>AS 1012.9-1999 'Methods of testing concrete - Determination of the compressive strength of concrete specimens'</em></span>.</p>
