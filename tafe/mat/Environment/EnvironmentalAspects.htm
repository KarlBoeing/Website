 <span class="style3"><strong>Measuring the environmental impact of Buildings and Building Materials</strong>.</span></b></span></p>
  <p class="style1">The
    emphasis on minimising environmental impacts of building and building materials
    has led to the development of several types of environmental assessment and
    management tools.</p>
  <p class="style1" style='line-height:normal'>These vary
    considerably in their type and intent and the complexity of their methodology.
    Some are used to access individual products or construction elements, such as
    air conditioners or timber chairs. Others are used to model the performance and
    effects of whole buildings or groups of buildings. They are then used to limit
    or manage their impacts. Governments have funded the development of some of
    these tools while others are prepared and promoted by environmental
    certification companies.</p>
  <p class="style1" style='line-height:normal'>Most of the tools
    have several major aspects in common. They generally seek to measure and rate:</p>
  <ul type=disc class="style1">
    <li style='line-height:
     normal;'><span class=GramE>the</span> energy cost
      and amounts of pollutants (solid and liquid waste, greenhouse gases,
      toxins and particles) resulting from extraction, manufacture, and
      transport.,</li>
    <li style='line-height:
     normal;'>the
      environmental and energy cost of fabrication and on-site waste and
      packaging</li>
    <li style='line-height:
     normal;'><span class=GramE>the</span> environmental
      impact occurring during the building's life from required operational
      energy, transport and generated pollutants.</li>
    <li style='line-height:normal;'><span class=GramE><span style='&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;'>the</span></span> environmental impact at the end of the life of the building or component
      (for example, the cost or implications of disposal).</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="style1" style='line-height:normal'>Not all of the
    tools are routinely used as the assessments are complex, lengthy and require
    detailed information and reporting. Also, as they differ in methodology, the
    results from different tools cannot be compared directly and may differ
    considerably.</p>
  <p class="style1" style='line-height:normal'>The types of
    methods or systems listed below include the recently developed National
    Australian Building Environmental Rating System and overviews of environmental
    management systems, environmental impact assessment, environmental audits, eco
    labelling, and the Building Material Ecological Sustainability Index.</p>
   <p align="left" class="style3" style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;'><b>Assessing the
    Environmental Impact of Building Materials</b></p>
  <p class=MsoNoSpacing>A life cycle assessment is one method that is used to measure the
    environmental impacts of building products. Alternative terms for a life cycle
    assessment include cradle to grave analysis, eco-balance, product lifecycle
    analysis, and resource and environmental profile analysis.</p>
  <p class=MsoNoSpacing>The aim of a life cycle assessment is to identify, quantify and
    assess the impact of the energy and materials used and wastes released to the
    environment throughout the life of a building product.</p>
  <p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are many life cycle assessment methodologies and the models
    vary in their complexity. They range from full life cycle assessments (used for
    publications, policy decisions and marketing claims) to streamlined approaches
    (used for comparisons and usually with the aid of a software tool) to
    guidelines and checklists.</p>
  <p class=MsoNoSpacing>Typically, there will be several stages that are considered. These
    include:</p>
  <ul>
  <li class="style1 style3 style4">
  mining/extraction/harvesting
      and transport to place of manufacture;</span><br />
      <li class="style1"><span class="style3">manufacturing;<br />
       </span>
    <li class="style1"><span class="style3">on
      site construction including transport to the building site;<br />
       </span>
    <li class="style1"><span class="style3">occupancy
      and maintenance;<br />
       </span>
    <li class="style1">demolition and
      disposal and recycling.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class=MsoNoSpacing>At each of these stages, there are a number of variables that can
    alter the outcome of the assessment. For example, the length of the life of the
    building may vary considerably depending on the durability of the building
    materials, fashion, demographic change or other factors such as recycling and
    deconstruction. So, even if a building has a relatively short life span, its
    impact may effectively be offset to some degree by recycling of the materials.</p>
  <p class=MsoNoSpacing>By allowing for comparison between various building products, a
    life cycle assessment can assist in making an informed decision about the
    choice of building materials. Because this type of assessment can also be used
    as a marketing tool to support the use of one material over another, it is
    important to view the environmental assessment critically and consider other
    factors such as structural, economic and aesthetic performance.</p>
  <p class=MsoNoSpacing>There are a
    number of methods available to conduct a life cycle assessment. This makes
    meaningful comparisons difficult. International organisations such as the
    International Standards Organisation and the Society of Environmental
    Toxicology and Chemistry are working towards standardising the process.</p>
  <p class=MsoNoSpacing>Life cycle
    assessments take time to carry out and require detailed information. Access to
    life cycle information on a range of building products is not yet readily
    available. Market demand for this information together with further development
    and refinement of the assessment tools should improve the availability of
    information.</p>
  <h1 class="style5">The energy consumed to manufacture building products</h1>
  <p class="style1">There is an increasing awareness of the need to conserve scarce
    resources by using products and practices that are energy efficient.</p>
  <p class="style1">Much of the energy consumed in <span class=SpellE>every day</span> living is derived from fossil fuels and this use can have significant
    environmental impacts by increasing greenhouse emissions.</p>
  <p class="style1">Until recently, efforts to improve the energy efficiency of
    buildings targeted their operational energy. That is, the energy used in the
    operation of the building (heat, power, and light). As a result, strategies
    focused on improving the performance of existing buildings and developing
    better practice for the design of new buildings.</p>
  <p class="style1">More recently, emphasis has been placed on the energy invested in
    the materials used to construct and maintain the building over its lifetime,
    that is, their embodied energy. This is also referred to as life cycle energy
    consumption.</p>
  <p class="style1">Recent studies have shown that over its lifespan, the embodied
    energy of a building can be greater than the operating energy. To obtain the
    best long term result, building design must consider both embodied energy and
    operational energy.</p>
  <p class="style1">  <span class="style1"><span style='font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;
'>The stages considered in an assessment of the energy consumed over
    the life of a building or building material are similar to the stages of a life
    cycle analysis and include the energy required to:  </span>
  <ul class="style1">
    <li>mine/extract/harvest the raw material and transport to the
      processing centre;<br />
      <li>manufacture the building materials;<br />
      <li>transport to the construction site;<br />
      <li>maintenance and refurbishment of the building; and<br />
      <li>demolish recycle and finally dispose of waste material.    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="style1">The consumption of energy during each of these stages can have
    similar environmental impacts to the consumption of energy in the operation of
    the building.</p>
  <p class="style1">There are two
    major methods for reporting and using embodied energy.</p>
  <ol class="style1">
    <li>Gross Energy
      Requirement (GER). This includes all of the energy inputs for a building in all
      stages listed above. This can be a very complex process as there are many
      variables within each stage. For example, the energy input into the
      construction of the building also includes the transport of the workers,
      equipment and materials.</li>
    <li>Process
      Energy Requirement (PER). The PER is the component of the GER that relates
      directly to the manufacture of the building material. The PER makes an
      allowance for procurement of raw materials, transport between manufacturing
      processes and the actual manufacture of the building material. This method more
      readily allows for comparisons to be made between various building materials.</li>
  </ol>
  <p class="style1">However, it is important that embodied energy comparisons are not
    viewed in isolation. For example, the insulating properties of a high embodied
    energy material may save significantly on a building’s heating energy
    requirements.</p>
