     <h2>a)   Ferrous metals</h2>
<h3>IRON:</h3>
      <P>Iron is produced in a blast furnace through a chemical reaction by smelting the iron ore.
      The iron is then further refined through additional melting and blending processes to create 
      products that’s listed beow:</P>
      <h3>1) CAST IRON:</h3>
      <P>Cast iron is another type of alloy that can 
      be refined from the initial material. Cast iron is stronger and less 
      breakable than the initial material, thanks to a process that removes 
      carbon, and other elements while adding desirable characteristics thanks 
      to melted scrap metal and steel. Once popular as bridge and building 
      material, cast iron is also used to create pots and pans that withstand 
      and distribute high heat evenly. </P>
      <h3>2) WROUGHT IRON</h3>
      <P>Wrought iron is a soft, easily worked, fibrous metal. It 
      usually contains less than 0.1%  carbon. 
      It is superior for most purposes to  cast 
      iron, which is hard and brittle because of its higher carbon 
      content.</P>
      <P>Since mild steel has replaced the wrought 
      iron, therefore it is no longer produced in large extent.</P>
      <h3><B>3) STEEL</B></h3>
      <P>Steel is an alloy of iron and carbon. Pure iron’s strength remarkably 
      increases when alloyed with carbon. The tensile strength increases with 
      increasing carbon content but the ductility reduces. Structural steel has 
     a low</SPAN> carbon content.</P>

        <LI><B>Medium-carbon steel :</B> carbon content is 0.30 to

      <h2>b) Non-Ferrous metals</h2>
      <P><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Non-ferrous metals are metals that do not 
      contain iron. There are two groups of metals; ferrous and non-ferrous. 
      Ferrous metals contain iron, for example carbon steel, stainless steel 
      (both alloys; mixtures of metals) and wrought iron. Non-ferrous metals 
      don't contain iron, for example aluminium, brass, copper (which can be 
      remembered as ABC) and titanium. You can also get non-ferrous metals as

      structural applications requiring reduced weight, higher strength, 
      nonmagnetic properties, higher melting points, or resistance to chemical

      <h2>c) Non

<p>These are metals which do not contain any iron. They are not 
      magnetic and are usually more resistant to corrosion than ferrous 
      metals.
     <p><font size="4px"><b>Brass</b></font>
      <br>Brass is a metal composed primarily of copper and zinc. Copper is 
      the main component, and brass is usually classified as a copper alloy. 
      Brass is stronger and harder than copper, but not as strong or hard as 
      steel. It is easy to form into various shapes, a good conductor of heat, 
      and generally resistant to corrosion from salt water. <BR><B>Uses in 
     Building:</B> plumbing, hose and brass tube fittings
     <p><font size="4px"><b>Bronze</b></font><br>
      It is hard 
      and brittle, and it was particularly significant in olden days, so much so 
      that the Bronze Age was named after the metal. Traditional bronze is a 
      copper alloy with up to 10% tin. The tin in bronze makes it more resistant 
      to wear than unalloyed copper. Bronze 
      parts are typically used for bearings, clips, electrical connectors and 
      sculpture.<br><br>Other 
      types of bronze:
      <p><b>Aluminium 
      bronze</B> is a 
      copper-aluminium alloy that may contain iron, nickel, and/or silicon for 
      greater strength. Aluminium bronze is frequently used for aircraft and 
      automobile engine parts.</p> <p><b>Manganese 
      bronze</B> (a brass 
      containing manganese. It is often used for ship propellers because it is 
      strong and resists saltwater corrosion)</P><center>
