        <h2>Foundation Material</h2>
        <p>Foundation is the natural material on which the building 
          rests. Generally base rock, especially of igneous origin, is the strongest 
          foundation material. </p>
        <p>           Remember to differentiate 
          between <strong>Foundation</strong> and <strong>Footing</strong></p>
        <p>Foundation material is categorised in simplistic manner 
          such as:</p>
        <p>           IGNEOUS ROCKS                     (Granite-Basalt)</p>
        <p>           SEDIMENTARY ROCKS         (Sandstone-Limestone)</p>
        <p>           METAMORPHIC ROCKS       (Conglomerates -Marble; Slates)</p>
        <p>                (Silts, 
          Sands, Gravels, compressed into rock like masses)<br />
          Variety of rocks is great and varies with locations</p>
        <p><strong>Soil</strong>  is the loose material that 
          results from the transformation of the underlying parent rock by more 
          or less simultaneous interaction of climatic factors (sun, wind, rain, 
          frost) and chemical changes, brought about by biological agents (flora 
          and fauna) and migration of chemical substances through rain, evaporation, 
          surface and underground water.</p>
        <p><strong>Gravel</strong>  Most gravels are a combination of coarse and fine particles 
          of rock and sands. Stability of gravel is good if clay content is neglected. 
          Usually good bearing capacity, and less prone to erosion than are sands.</p>
        <p><strong>Sand</strong>  composed of fine grains 
          and hard minerals and considered as a cohesionless soil. A suitable 
          foundation material, but  unprotected 
          prone to erosion by wind action. </p>
        <p>Sand dunes 
          in waterfront locations, particularly near the ocean, provide very risky 
          foundations..</p>
        <p><strong>Clay</strong>  expand and becomes plastic 
          when wet, retains water and dries out very slowly. Clay is a cohesive 
          soil and usually inadequate as foundation material because of the high 
          degree of expansion and contraction between wet and dry conditions. 
          When using as foundation consult soil-engineer about its suitability.</p>
        <p>For specific building sites it is advisable to consult 
          soil engineer to ascertain the subsurface materials and the levels at 
          which they occur to make sure the foundation material is suitable for 
          the proposed building.</p>

        <h2><font size="3">Stone</font></h2>
        </a>
        <p style='page-break-after:avoid'>The term ‘stone’ usually 
          designates blocks or pieces of the basic material rock (refer to foundation 
          material). It is one of the oldest building materials known to persons. 
          Natural stone and soils have been used as building material  for more than 10000 years, and earth walling particularly has been 
          formally tested, documented and accepted under some building codes and 
          enjoys popularity in some countries.</p>
        <p>Stone used for building purposes 
          are generally classified according to the form in which it is available 
          commercially:   <strong>1</strong>. rubble (fieldstone)  <strong>2</strong>. dimension (cut stone) <strong>3</strong>. flag-stone (flat slabs) <strong>4</strong>. crushed rock</p>
        <p>Despite the abundance of rock, relatively few stones 
          satisfy the requirements as building stones. The important requirements 
          are:</p>
        <p><strong>1</strong>. strength,   <strong>2</strong>. hardness,   <strong>3</strong>. workability, <strong>4</strong>. durability, <strong>5</strong>. colour and grain <strong>6</strong>. porosity 
          and texture<br />
      <strong>7</strong>. ease of quarrying   <strong>8</strong>. accessibility.</p>
        <p>Stone which 
          does, in general, satisfy the foregoing requirements and which is commonly 
          used in building include granite, limestone, travertine, marble, sandstone, 
          and slate.</p>
        <p>The process 
          of removing stone from its natural bed is known as quarrying. The method 
          of quarrying depends on the nature of the stone. The building industry 
          today uses stone largely as a facing material for large buildings, but 
          it is also used for loadbearing walls for two or three storey buildings.</p>
        <p><strong>Granite</strong> a coarsely crystalline igneous 
          stone. It is generally very hard, strong, durable, and capable of taking 
          a high polish. Granite has a wide variety of uses in building, including 
          flooring, interior and exterior wall facing, column and mullion facings, 
          stairs etc.</p>
        <p><strong>Basalt</strong> generally a fine grained 
          crystalline igneous stone of dark grey to blue grey colour. It comes 
          from volcanic origin, is very hard wearing, and used as crushed aggregates 
          for concrete (blue metal).</p>
        <p><strong>Limestone</strong> a sedimentary class of stone, 
          the most widely used building stone in the world. Limestones are composed 
          mainly of two basic ingredients calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate, 
          together with other elements in lesser amounts. </p>
        <p><strong>Sandstone</strong> <span style="font-family: Symbol"> </span>a sedimentary class of stone, 
          like limestone, made up of silica grains cemented together. The cement 
          may be silica, calcium carbonate, or clay. The hardness and durability 
          of the particular sandstone depends on the type of cement.</p>
        <p><strong>Marble</strong> an example of a metamorphic 
          rock, one that has been changed from its original structure. Stone. 
          in this case limestone and dolomite have been re-crystallised to form 
          marble. The colours of marble range from pure white through all shades 
          of grey to black, including violet, red, yellow, pink, and green. Marble 
          can be carved or turned and brought to a high polish. It is used mainly 
          wall panels, column encasing, paving slabs, stair threads, balustrades 
          etc.</p>
        <p><strong>Slate</strong> a metamorphic rock, formed 
          by the metamorphosis of clay and shales which have been deposited in 
          layers. A unique characteristic of the material is the relative ease 
          with which it may be separated into thin sheets, called slates. Nowadays 
          seldom used as roofing material but for flooring, interior and exterior 
          wall facing, windowsills, countertops, coping and caps etc.</p>

        <h2>Clay products</h2>
        </a>
        <p>Are made by shaping a plastic mass of clay and water 
          which is then hardened by drying and firing. Glazed products require 
          an initial firing to produce the ‘biscuit’ to which the glaze is then 
          applied and the product re-fired in various sizes and shapes. All properties 
          are affected by the composition of the raw material used.</p>
        <p><strong>Bricks </strong> they are produced as ‘common’ 
          and ‘face bricks’ in a variety of sizes and shapes, but the prime factor 
          controlling all brick dimensions is the size and weight of a unit that 
          can be grasped in one hand. Four method of shaping are commonly used: 
          1 Hand moulding, 2 Extruding, 3 Dry pressing and 4&nbsp;Machine moulding.<br />
          Bricks can satisfactorily resist compressive and low shear stresses, but they are not able to resist tensile stresses. The compressive stress of clay bricks varies from about 10 to 100 MPa, but the strength of brickwork is generally dependent on the quality of mortar used. Extruded bricks, even when heavily perforated, are stronger than solid pressed bricks.</p>
        <p><strong>Roof tiles</strong>  made in a variety of styles, 
          including French tile, Spanish tile, Roman tile, English tile, Mission 
          tile etc, but pattern used in Western Australia are mainly Marseille 
          and Swiss. <br />
          Roof tiles are used for sloping roofs between about 15° and 50° inclination of rafter, and tile shape differ for each range of slope. It should be remembered that the rafter pitch is always steeper than the tile pitch.</p>
        <p><strong>Ceramics</strong> all productions that results 
          in baked clay of different grades of hardness and purity. The term ‘pottery’ 
          is also used to categorise these products. Terms associated with ceramics 
          are <i>terra cotta, earthenware, 
          stoneware, china and porcelain. </i></p>
        <p><i><strong>Ceramic tiles</strong></i> available in many sizes and shapes. they are used as wall and floor 
          tiles in bathrooms, washrooms, kitchens, laboratories etc.</p>
        <p><i><strong>Ceramic fittings</strong></i> or 
          vitreous china for sanitary plumbing items such as toilet pans, wall 
          and vanity basins, bath and showers etc.</p>

        <p>Concrete is an artificial stone produced in a plastic 
          condition by mixing together ‘aggregates’, (sand and crushed rock) and 
          a ‘matrix’ (cement and water) all in controlled portions. The chemical 
          reaction between the cement and water produces strong binding qualities 
          so that on drying out the resulting material is hard, dense and able 
          to resist compressive stresses. Climatic conditions also affect the 
          quality of concrete. Steel bars incorporated in sections of the concrete 
          giving it good tensile as well as compressive strength if correctly 
          placed in the member</p>
        <p><strong>Concrete

        <h2><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><font size="3">Mortar</font></span></h2>
        </a>
        <p>Mortar joints bond bricks together allowing the brickwork to act as a structural element to carry both vertical and lateral loads. The performance of brickwork depends very much on the 
          properties of the hardened mortar, and the quality of the workmanship 
          of the bricklayer. Mortar is a mixture of sand ,lime/cement and water, 
          measured out by volume or weight, then thoroughly mixed together. The 
          mortar should be mixed with a minimum amount of water that is possible 
          to use and still maintain the proper plasticity. If mixed mortar loses 
          water by evaporation and stiffened, additional water may be added and 
          the mortar remixed. However, water should not be added to the mortar 
          which has began to stiffen because the set has begun. Mortars should 
          be used within two hours after mixing, under normal temperature condition. 
          Mixing can be done in small mechanical cement mixers, or by hand.</p>
        <p>There are three types of mortar used in brick and block 
          work, 1 lime mortar, 2 cement mortar, and 3 composite mortar, each for 
          a specific purposes.</p>
        <p><strong>Lime mortar</strong> <br />
          usually 
          mixed in the proportion of one part lime to three parts sand by volume. 
          The mortar has a low degree of shrinkage, is slowly hardening, and easy 
          to work with.. It is much weaker in compression and shear than cement 
          or composition (compo) mortars. </p>
        <p><strong>Cement mortar mixed </strong><br />
          Cement mortar mixed 
          in different proportions, depending on the application. It is the strongest 
          mortar, and is used where the brickwork is heavily loaded and where 
          it is subject to damp, such as below the damp proof course (DPC) and 
          in basement walls and in chimneys above the roof line. The mortar has 
          a high degree of shrinkage, is quick hardening, and very hard to work 
          with. Mortars which are rich in cement tend to cause unsightly cracking 
          of masonry.</p>
        <p> <strong>Composition mortar</strong> <br />
          Composition mortar also 
          called cement/lime mortar, is an elastic term, covering a wide range 
          of mixes. At one extreme is one part cement, three parts lime, and twelve 
          parts sand (1:3:12), and at the other extreme three parts cement, one 
          part lime, and twelve parts sand (3:1:12). Probably the most satisfactory 
          mix for all-round general construction is one part cement, one part 
          lime and six parts of sand (1:1:6).The presence of lime in such mixes 
          gives good working qualities but reduces the rate of hardening and the 
          final strength. Although the mix still shrinks on drying, the slower 
          hardening rate tends towards less harmful type of cracking.</p>
        
        <p>Masonry admixtures have many advantageous properties,  retarding the setting time,  repelling water, controlling efflorescence, increasing weather resistance, etc. but they have to be used correctly to work effectively. Admixtures are substances other than the prescribed materials of water, aggregate, and cementitious materials that are used to improve one or more of the recognized desirable properties of conventional masonry mortar. </p>

        <h2><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><font size="3">Timber products</font></span></h2>
        </a>
        <p>Timber is not only one of the oldest building materials, 
          along with stone, earth and various vegetable materials, but has remained 
          until today the most versatile and in terms of indoor comfort and health 
          aspects, most acceptable material. Its a extremely complex material, 
          available in a great variety of species and forms, suitable for all 
          kinds of applications. The diversity of timber products and application 
          requires a good knowledge of the respective properties and limitations 
          as well as skill and experience in order to derive maximum benefits 
          from timber usage.</p>
        <p>Although only small portion of the timber harvested 
          is used for building, the universal concern about the rapid depletion 
          of forests, especially the excessive felling of large old trees (which 
          take hundred of years to replace) and the great environmental, climatic 
          and economic disasters that follow deforestation, has led to a great 
          deal of research into alternative materials and rationalised timber 
          utilisation. Since timber cannot be completely replaced by other materials, 
          it shall remain one important building material. AS 1684 specifies the requirements timber framed construction </p>

          or curved structural members of very large (even varying) cross-section 
          and great length can be produced with low grade timber of small sizes, 
          achieving high strength.</p>

      <h2><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><font size="3"> <a name="sec9" id="sec9">Glass</a></font></span></h2>
      <p>The art of glass making is very old, and today the 
        industry uses basically the same raw materials as did the ancient glassmakers. 
        However, the methods of manufacturing have changed and extremely improved 
        resulting in high production rates, superior glass, and very great sheet 
        sizes. Glass is a hard, brittle non-structural building material produced 
        by the fusion of a mixture of silica with soda, lime and other minor 
        ingredients such as magnesia and alumina, to produce a material for 
        general window glazing.</p>
      <p><strong>Float glass</strong><br />
         transparent 
        with 85% light transmission and a truly flat glass with undistorted 
        vision. It is formed by floating a continuous ribbon of molten glass 
        over a bath of molten tin at a controlled rate and temperature.</p>
      <p><strong>Rolled glass</strong><br />produced 
        by passing the ribbon of glass between rollers during cooling. The roller 
        regulate the thickness and impart the pattern to the glass. It can be 
        reinforced with wire mesh for safety and fire resistant glazing purposes.</p>
      <p><strong>Insulating 
        glass</strong><br />consist 
        of two or more panes of glass, separated by an air space, and joint 
        at the edges to produce a hermetically sealed unit. The air space (usually 
        13 mm) is dehydrated with a drying agent to ensure no moisture build-up.</p>
      <p><strong>Toughened 
        glass</strong><br />
         plate glass which is subjected 
        to a process of heating and sudden cooling results in a toughened glass 
        with increased mechanical strength and greater resistant to impact and 
        temperature changes. Also referred to as safety glass. It disintegrates 
        into small pieces and powder when broken.</p>
      <p><strong>Tinted glass </strong><br />this 
        type of glass is specially tinted to reduce solar heat and cut down 
        glare.</p>
      <p><strong>Laminated glass</strong><br />also 
        referred to as safety glass, made from two or more layers of glass bonded 
        together with a film of a tough transparent plastic. The main reason 
        for laminating glass in this manner is to increase its resistant to 
        breakage. It, like toughened glass, is used in vehicles and aeroplanes 
        rather than in building.</p>
      <p>Their are variety of other types available such as:</p>
      <p><strong>Lead glass</strong><br />
        lead oxide is added to the 
        glass to accomplish protection from dangerous rays such as X-rays and 
        gamma rays.</p>
      <p><strong>Mirrors</strong><br />are made by a continuous 
        silvering process on large sheets of glass. The glass is cleaned, tinned, 
        silvered, then coppered, painted and baked to protect the silver coating.</p>
      <p><strong>Glass 
        blocks</strong><br />
         they are made in two separate 
        halves which are heat-sealed together to form a hollow unit with reasonably 
        high thermal efficiency and sound insulation.</p>
      <p><strong>Glass 
        tiles</strong><br />
        another glass product. Its 
        primary purpose is to admit light into the building.</p>

      <h2><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><font size="3"><a name="sec10" id="sec10"> Plastics </a></font></span></h2>
      <p>The term ‘<i>plastics</i>’ 
        refers to a group of organic materials, most of which are synthetic 
        and which are shaped or formed by the application of heat and pressure. 
        Some plastics can be softened by heating, whereas other are unaffected  unless they are heated to a sufficient high temperature to cause 
        decomposition. All plastics fall into two general classifications:</p>
      <p><i><strong>(1) thermoplastics</strong></i> <strong><i>and<br /> 
        (2) thermosetting plastics</i></strong>, (called <i>thermosets)</i>.</p>
      <p>The properties of may plastics make them desirable 
        materials for use over a wide area of the construction field. Properties 
        such as transparency, resistance to discolouration, weatherproof, good 
        dimensional stability, toughness, high impact resistance, low moisture 
        absorption, ductility, good adhesive qualities, resistance to chemicals, 
        etc. With the perfection of manufacturing process, any size and shape 
        can be produced quickly and accurately. Plastics are now being used 
        as structural and non-structural components, in composite applications, 
        and as auxiliary material.</p>
      <p><strong>Thermoplastics</strong><br />
         become 
        soft when heated and hard when cooled, regardless of the number of times 
        the process is repeated. This is possible because thermoplastics have 
        linear molecule chains, which move in relation to one another when heated 
        or cooled and solidify into new shapes without any significant chain 
        breakage occurring.</p>
      <p>            Examples:   Polythene, Polypropylene, 
        Polyvinylchloride (PVC), Polystyrene Nylon Acrylics, eg Perspex etc.</p>
      <p><strong>Thermosets</strong><br />do 
        not re-soften or melt on further application of heat and retain their 
        shape because of the formation of cross links between molecule in adjacent 
        chains. The result is a complex, interconnected network, in which the 
        chains are no longer free to move, making the structure more rigid but 
        also more brittle.</p>
      <p>              Examples:   Epoxy resin, Polyester resin, 
        Synthetic rubbers, Polyurethanes Phenolics, eg Bakelite, Urea and melamine 
        formaldehyde resins</p>

      <h2><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><font size="3"> <a name="sec11" id="sec11">Coatings</a> </font></span></h2>
      <p>The most common form of coating is paint. The base 
        or content can vary considerably. The choice of coating used depends 
        upon the application, examples of which are follows:</p>
      <p><strong>Metallic</strong><br />
        electroplating, hot dipping, 
        metal spraying, condensation of metal vapours, metal cladding cementation.</p>
      <p><strong>Non-metallic</strong><br />
        oxides, 
        phosphates, chromates.</p>
      <p><strong>Paints</strong><br />
        metal-rich, 
        oil-based, plastic-based, resin-based, rubber-based.</p>
      <p>Coatings of paint are applied to nearly every type 
        of article and structure. These coatings provide protection against 
        corrosion, increase the resistance to hard wear, and give the item or 
        structure a more pleasing appearance.</p>
      <p>A paint consists of a suspension of fine pigments in 
        a liquid medium, sometimes called vehicle, and is applied in a liquid 
        or plastic condition and subsequently hardens to form a solid coating. 
        The solid particles in a paint are called pigments. The pigment is chosen 
        because it possesses certain properties or a particular combination 
        of properties, (eg anti-corrosive properties). It may be used because 
        it confers some or all of the following properties on the paint film: 
        colour, greater strength and adhesion, improved durability and weathering 
        properties, reduced gloss, modified flow an application properties, 
        etc.</p>
      <p>Pigments are either:   synthetic, 
        (ie man made),or natural 
        and organic or inorganic chemicals.</p>
      <p>The desirable properties of the medium or vehicle are:      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>it 
          thoroughly wets the particles of the pigment,</li>
        <li> it 
          should be sufficient viscous to hold the particles in suspension when 
          the paint is drying, but sufficiently fluid to make application easy.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The performance of any coating material is related 
        directly to the thoroughness and quality of the preparation of the surface 
      prior to application of the coating.</font></p>
      <p><strong>Priming paints</strong><br />
         these are the first coat 
        paints used to seal the surface, protect the surface against damp air, 
        act as a barrier to prevent any chemical action between the surface 
        and finishing coat, and to give a smooth surface for the subsequent 
        coats. Priming paints are produced for application to wood, metal and 
        plastered surfaces.</p>
      <p><strong>Undercoating 
        paints</strong><br />these are used to build 
        up the protective coating and to provide the correct surface for the 
        finishing coat(s). Undercoat paints contain a greater percentage of 
        pigment than finishing paints and as a result have matt or flat finish. 
        To obtain a good finish colour it is essential to use an undercoat of 
        the type and colour recommended by the manufacturer.</p>
      <p><strong>Finishing 
        paint </strong><br />a wide range of colour and 
        finishes including matt, semi-matt, eggshell, satin, gloss and enamel 
        are available. These paints usually contain a synthetic resin which 
        enables them to be easily applied, quick drying and have good adhesive 
        properties.</p>

      <h2><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><font size="3"> <a name="sec12" id="sec12">Adhesives</a></font></span></h2>
      <p>The art of making and using glues of various kinds 
        has been known for a very long time. Many of the materials used in ancient 
        times were natural products, such as bitumen and tree resins, while 
        others were made by hand by processes which were kept closely guarded 
        secrets. Adhesiveness is the ability of a material to fix itself and 
        cling to an entirely different material.</p>
      <p>The growth of the plastic industry has resulted in 
        the development of many new glues made from synthetic resins.</p>
      <p><strong>Animal glue</strong><br />
         is 
        available in either solid or liquid form.  Animal glue has excellent bonding properties with  wood, leather, 
        paper or cloth, developing up to 90 MPa in shear.</p>
      <p><strong>Casein glue</strong><br />
        made 
        from protein materials, is a dry powder to be mixed with water. It has 
        good bonding power for wood-to-wood or paper-to-wood application, and 
        will develop the full strength of the wood in most situations.</p>
      <p><strong>Asphalt cements</strong><br />
        are 
        thermoplastic materials made from asphalt emulsion or asphalt cutbacks. 
        They have good bond to paper and concrete and are used mainly for roofing 
        applications.</p>
      <p><strong>Urea formaldehyde resins</strong><br />are 
        available in powder form, to be mixed with water, and in liquid form, 
        which requires the addition of a hardener. They are thermosetting in 
        nature with excellent bond to wood, leather, or paper, having a shear 
        strength up to 21.5 MPa</p>
      <p><strong>Phenolic resin glues</strong><br />
        made 
        in both dry and liquid form. They are thermosetting glues as the above 
        with similar shear strength and excellent bond to wood and paper.</p>
      <p>Melamine resins      also 
        thermosetting glue manufactured as a powder with a separate catalyst. 
        They have excellent bond with wood or paper.</p>
      <p><strong>Epoxy resin adhesives</strong><br />are 
        among the most versatile of all modern adhesives, since formulation 
        of the material may be developed to suit a particular requirement. They 
        are thermosetting , manufactured in liquid form with a separate catalyst. 
        The amount of catalyst added to the resin determines to a large extent 
        the type of curing required. They have excellent bond with wood, metal, 
        glass, and masonry.</p>

      <h2><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><font size="3"> <a name="sec13" id="sec13">Sealants</a></font></span></h2>
      <p>A sealant is a material used to fill the joint between 
        two adjoining elements of structure in order to render it moisture and 
        air-tight. Often the successful performance of other building components 
        depends on the proper functioning of the joints between them. The width 
        of the joint to be used in any specific case depends on the calculated 
        amount of movement at the joint and the type of sealant to be used. 
        To be useful in such variety of functions, a sealant must have a number 
        of specific properties:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>      It must be able to adhere to surfaces with which it comes in contact.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>It must remain workable over a considerable range of temperature.</li>
        <li>It must be able to form a tough, elastic skin over the surface, while 
          the interior of the mass remains flexible.</li>
        <li>It must be able to stretch or elongate with changes that may occur in 
          the width of the joint</li>
        <li>It must be able to recover well after having been extended or compressed.</li>
        <li>It must have very low sensitivity 
          to water</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Mastics</strong><br /> can be oil based general 
        purpose mastic, which is a low cost general purpose caulking compound 
        for most common building materials, or a rubber/bitumen sealing compound, 
        for sealing joints where bituminous compounds are accepted (eg retaining 
        walls, roofing, flashings). Accommodates up to <span style='font-family:GreekMathSymbols;
