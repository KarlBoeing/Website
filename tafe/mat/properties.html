      <p>All materials have certain qualities and characteristics that can be  defined and tested. The main properties of construction materials include compressive strength, tensile strength, density, durability, conductivity and porosity. Many other properties exist including thermal conductivity, fire resistance, sound resistance and appearance. Certain materials are  designed to have specific  properties. A material may be designed to have very high compressive strength (for example concrete).</p>
      <p>All materials need to comply with Australian standards and Building Code of Australia to ensure they are fit for their  intended purpose.</p>
      <p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">To consider the behaviour of the building materials we should be able to define their properties. As can be seen there are properties like chemical, physical, mechanical and dimensional. The most important properties are the mechanical. These properties, which include strength, elasticity, ductility, malleability, plasticity, brittleness, toughness, and hardness can be changed and not the others.</span></p>
      <h3>The <span class="c4"><em>mechanical</em></span> properties are defined below:</h3>

      <p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">The strength of a material is the resistance which e.g. 1 mm² of section can offer to a load, which will just cause fracture. This breaking strength is also referred to as ultimate strength. All stress related figures refer to the yield strength. Up to the yield point the material behavior is elastic. That means limit strength, the word indicates the resistance offered by the material under the conditions implied, usually in the form of strength per mm² of section, or stress, for comparative purposes.</span></p>
      <strong>Stress:</strong> Force per unit area within materials that arises from externally applied forces. It is the <strong><em>internal reaction                force</em></strong> in a material created by an external loading.
