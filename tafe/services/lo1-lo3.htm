      <p><b>1.1    Explain the variouis water sources and common reticulation 
        systems</b><br>
        <span
lang=EN-US>The two main water sources are catchment water (catchment area is a 
        protected area generally no buildings here), collected in dams and ground 
        water. Usually dams are at higher elevations and the water is gravity 
        fed to major outlets (reservoirs and then to water towers). Pumps may 
        be needed if the elevation is insufficient. In remote areas the roof is 
        used to collect rainwater for human consumption, and small dams or untreated 
        groundwater is used for normal utilization.</span><br>
        <span>          </span>An intricate pipe network is used in cities for 
        the distribution to the consumer. The primary feeders form the skeleton 
        of the distribution system. Secondary feeders carry large quantities of 
        water to the various areas and from here smaller distribution mains forms 
        a grid over the area to be served. Feeder mains are often looped to reduce 
        shutdowns. The flow in pipes is turbulent and friction losses depend upon 
        the roughness of the pipe, the velocity and the diameter.</p>
      <p><b>1.2    Describe common domestic installations</b><br>
        <span
lang=EN-US>The supply of water to residential building is usually provided through 
        water towers. They provide a pressure of a minimum of 15 meter head. The 
        Water Corporation installs a water meter and from here the builder is 
        responsible for the domestic installation (see Figure 1).</span></p>
      <p><b>1.3    State the relevant materials used for the distribution of water 
        throughout installation</b><br>
        <span
lang=EN-US>There is a large range of piping used for water supply. A variety of 
        materials can be used but according to the BCA (Part 1.2.2) evidence of 
        suitability must be given. The most common materials for pipes are:</span></p>

      <b>1.4    Explain the necessity 
        for the installation of water storage tanks in buildings relative to the 
        public water supply and reservoir heights &amp;</font></b><br>
     <b>1.5    Describe how pumps 
        are used to maintain water levels in storage tanks, including single and 
        two stage pumping</b></font><br>
      As mentioned in 1.2 the Water 
        Corporation provides us with a minimum of 15 meter head. It will be  obvious 
        that no water can be drawn from an outlet at a higher level than the water 
        tower. Therefore multi storey buildings must have storage tanks or a pneumatic 
        or pressurised system to supply water at higher levels. Pumps are used 
        to fill the storage tanks. The pump should not be connected directly to 
        the mains, and break tanks should be installed. The size of the break 
        tank must be correctly designed to prevent stagnation of the water. To 
        ensure a constant supply a second pump is needed for back up. Pumps must 
        be capable to overcome the static lift, friction losses in the pipe work 
        and any other resistance. From the storage tanks the water is gravity 
        fed to the outlets.<br>
        <span>         </span>A pneumatic unit incorporates pumps, pressure vessels, 
        air compressor and a control panel usually mounted on a common base. The 
        pump cycle is controlled by the change of air or gas pressure which occur 
        when water is drawn off and subsequently replaced A given volume of water 
        can therefore be removed for a given change in pressure.</font><br><br>
  <b>1.6    Describe the possible 
        interconnection of water storage tanks for fire protection and the importance 
        of non return valves</b></font><br>
      <span lang=EN-US>In high-rise 
        buildings water storage tanks for normal consumption and storage tanks 
        for fire fighting purposes can be interconnected to provide a sufficient 
        amount of water (flow rate see AS 2419). According to, AS 2118.6 there 
        are two separate storage tanks required, or two mains interconnected, 
        or one main and one on site storage tank. If a swimming pool is found 
        on the top floor of a high-rise building the water is most likely used 
        for fire fighting purposes (an example is Observation City in Scarborough). 
        If water storage tanks for normal consumption and storage tanks for fire 
        fighting purposes are interconnected than a non return valve is required 
        to prevent back-flow into the system and avoid contamination. </span></font>

 <span lang=EN-US>Main sewer lines are commonly found in the street reserve 
        or at the back of a property boundary. The latter has the advantage the 
        no street crossing is needed for the sewer and the two adjacent properties 
        can be served from the same sewer. The attached plan shows an outline 
        of a combined system. The builder will get a plan with the exact location 
        of the sewer free of charge from the Water Corporation. Flimsy</span></p>

        <span
lang=EN-US><img width=202 height=153 src="image002.gif" align=left hspace=12 v:shapes="_x0000_s1026">Traps 
        must be installed in drainage and waste systems to prevent the discharge 
        of noxious gases from the sewer through plumbing fixtures into the house. 
        The traps are so designed that an amount of water stays in a U-shaped 
        bend (see Figure blow). Internal traps are those mounted to fixtures inside 
        the building; external traps are fitted to the drainage system outside 
        the building. The formation of sewer gases produces an increase pressure 
        in the system, and to ensure that the water-seal does not break a minimum 
        75 mm waster-seal is needed. There are a number of ways in which a trap 
        may loose its water-seal. Syphonage is the most common causes of loss 
        of seal in traps, and this can be prevented if vent pipes are used. When 
        fixtures are not used for some time, the water in the trap will gradually 
        evaporate unless the trap is periodically replenished with water. However, 
        loss of seal in traps can be attributed to other causes as well.</span></font><br>
        <span>          </font></span>The depositing 
        of prohibited discharges into a property sewer is not allowed. Prohibited 
        discharges are grease, dust, ashes, rubbish, petrol, oil, etc., and special 
        traps are needed to collect these discharges. Also rain- roof- or surface 
        water cannot be discharged into the property sewer.</font></p>

        fire fighting appliances, electrical cables, telephone etc. The size must 
        be large enough to allow an operative to stand inside while attending 
        the services.<br>
        <span>          </span>The horizontal duct group generally includes major 
        services ways such as walkways and crawlways and occurs at ground or sub-ground 
        level. These horizontal ducts contain the bulk of the pipe and cable services 
        from the supplier to the consumer. Some buildings like hospitals and factories 
        have horizontal ducts in the basement or below to transfer the services 
        from the various verticals within the building. These walkways have there 
        own lighting system and electrical power points and access is provided 
        at regular interval.<br>
        <span>          </span>Lateral distribution of services on each floor 
        may often be via suspended ceilings. There is a variety of ceiling systems 
        available and the most common is panel type that allows easy access to 
        the ceiling void by removing the panels from the suspension framework. 
        Sometimes in commercial buildings there may be one lateral duct on each 
        floor to service both male and female toilets. Both toile areas backing 
        onto the full length of the duct.<br>

        <span lang=EN-US><img src="pump3.jpg" width="106" height="169" align="left">Sometimes 
        it is necessary to install plumbing fixtures at levels and locations below 
        the property sewer. The wastes and/or discharges are conveyed to a temporary 
        storage system and then pumped up to and into the property sewer There 
        are two individual types, one for the purposes of all wastes, that is 
        sewage and waste water, and the other for the purposes of waste water 
        only. In both cases pumps are used to raise the waste to the required 
        level.</span><br>
        <span>          </span>Float switches are required to activate a pumps 
        (submersible or outside the collection chamber) to pump sewage out. The 
        attached sketch shows the procedure.</p>
      <p><b>2.8    Discuss septic tanks and soakage systems used in applications 
        other than domestic situations</b><br>
     <span lang=EN-US>In areas that are outside a proclaimed sewered area 
        or where connection to a sewage system is impractical, the best alternative 
        is a septic tank system and disposal of the effluent below ground. The 
        septic tank is in fact a mini sewage treatment plant. It is watertight, 
        usually made of concrete, and it treats all household wastewater from 
        bathroom, toilet, kitchen, and laundry. Many residential houses in Perth 
        are still on septic systems. Most systems have two connected cylindrical 
        tanks, concrete tops with inspection openings above both inlets and outlets.</span><br>
      <span>          </span>When wastewater passes through the tanks, heavy 
        solids such as faecial material, food scraps and sands sink to the bottom 
        and form sludge. Light material such as grease, fats and some paper products 
        float to the top and form a scum. Most of the sludge and scum accumulate 
        in the first tank, but some will always carry over to the second tank. 
        Solids are broken down by bacterial action.<br>
     <span>          </span>The effluent passes from the second tank into 
        as soil absorption system. All soakage units must be fitted with a flow 
        alteration device irrespective of the soil type and absorptive capacity 
        of that soil. Soakage units are soakwells, leach drains and French drains.<br>
        <span>          </span> The control of a septic tank and soakage system 
        installation is the responsibility of the Public Health Department of 
        WA. The septic tank &amp; soakage system or for short <i><b>aerobic treatment 
        unit</b></i> is an apparatus for treating sewage either wholly or partially 
        by aerobic means and includes any associated effluent disposal system.

      <p><b>3.3 </b>         <b>Describe the various soakage units according to 
        soil type for disposal of rainwater and from roof and paved areas.</b><br>
<span lang=EN-US>When it rains, some of the rainwater runs off, some 
        is absorbed in the ground, and some of it seeps through the soil until 
        it reaches the water table. The run-off from buildings and paved areas 
        may be drained into stormwater drain or soakwells.</span><br>
    <span lang=EN-US>A soakage unit can be a perforated pipe lay in a sub-surface 
        rubble drain filled with aggregates of various sizes, or a prefabricated 
        perforated concrete or PVC unit.</span><br>
      <span lang=EN-US>For residential buildings PVC units diameter 600 mm 
        and 900 mm in depth are used for small roof areas. Two down pipes may 
        be connected for each soakage unit in well-drained soil. Lager units must 
        be used for soils with poor drainage qualities. Clay soils, for example, 
        can be more or less impervious and require special care. In such cases 
        lager soakage units or rubble drains are needed. The length and size of 
        rubble drain trenches with perforated pipes, or the size of the soakwell 
        depends on the drainage quality of the soil. For Perth soils prefabricated 
        concrete soakwells usually 1200 mm in diameter and 1200 mm in height, 
    are often used if poorer drainage quality is encountered.</span></p></td>
