      <h3 ALIGN=CENTER>Using the Theodolite</h3>
	  <p>In Surveying 2 we use a theodolite to determine (read) both horizontal 
        and vertical angles to an accuracy of 20" and mark out the buildings on 
        College ground using theodolite and tape (Module requirements)
      <p><img src="theo2.jpg" width="390" height="345" align="left">A theodolite 
        is an instrument for measuring both horizontal and vertical angles. It 
        consists of a telescope mounted movably within two perpendicular axes, 
        the horizontal and vertical axis. <br>
        All students should ask Steven Rolling for the <b>Sokkia</b> instrument. 
        If all students use the same instrument then the reading scales and other 
        feature of the theodolite can be easily compared between the different 
        groups of students.<br>
        The left instrument in the opposit figure shows a Wild Theodolite and 
        the right instrument shows a Sokkia Theodolite.<br>

      <img src="read-micro.gif" align="left"> 
      <p> The opposite figure shows a typical view through the microscope eye 
        piece. The microscope eyepiece is located adjacent (right) to the telescope 
        eye piece. Two set of parallel lines (0&deg; and 360&deg;} are seen in 
        the H window. If the observed reading in the H-window is <img src="degree-scale.gif" width="171" height="80" align="left" vspace="15">245&deg; 
        sitting between 50' and 60' divisions you need to turn the mircometer 
        knob until the parallel 245&deg; lines are biseced by the 50' line as 
        shown in figure. Then the window above the H window will shows in the 
        top row the minute and below the seconds. The final reading as shown in 
        the figure is 245&deg; 53' 18&quot;. (The seconds reading is scaled and 
        not precise.) <br>
        The vertical circle (V-window) is read in a similar manner.

      <p><a name="3"><b>Using the Vertical Angles and the distances to determine the height.</b></a><br>
        The measured vertical angle combined with the distance to any object can 
        be used to determine the height of an object. Most modern theodolites 
        will automatically set the reference direction for the vertical circle 
        once the theodolite is leveled. Zero degrees for the vertical circle is 
        usually set at the zenith (vertically above the theodolite). The vertical 
        angle is then the angle from the zenith down to the line of observation. 
        Points on equal elevation (horizontal plane) to the theodolite will therefore 
        be at 90 degrees. Basically the precision for our vertical angle measurement 
        will determine the accuracy of measured positions. </p>
      <p><img src="height-m.gif" width="345" height="281" align="left"><b>Procedures 
        to measure vertical and horizontal angles</b><br>
        Aim at the first specified corner of the building and <b>zero</b> the 
        horizontal circle reading. Readings for horizontal angles should be either 
        in a clock wise or anti clock wise direction. Do not change directions 
        and close the cirle at 360&deg;. Then read the vertical angles (angle 
        of elevation &amp; angle of depression) to determine the height of the 
        corner of the building. Make sure the sighting points are verticle above 
        each other. After that sight the next specified corner and read the horizontal 
        angle, and note the reading of the vertical angles.The horizontal distance 
        between all specified building corners must be exactly measured. (<font color="#000000">Note 
        the distance to</font><font color="#0000FF"> angle A</font> is different 
        to <font color="#808000">angle A</font>.) Continue reading horizontal 
        and vertical angles as well as distance measures until the specified corners 
        of all buildings are completed. 
      <div align="right">
        <p><A HREF="#top">back to top</A></p>
      </div>
      <a name="4"><b>Height calculations</b></a><br>
      We use the <i>tan-function</i> to calculate the height. As shown in the 
      figure above the height is determined by measuring two angles (angle of 
      elevation &amp; angle of depression). To calculate the Height A multiply 
      the horizontal distance on for your first height reading by the tan of the 
      related angle.
<div align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#808000">Height 
        A = horizontal distance x tan 90&deg;- A&deg;</font></div>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FF0000">Height 
        B = horizontal distance x tan B&deg;</font><font color="#FF0000">- 90&deg; 
        </font>
      <p>Now add both distances together. Add this measurent to the known reduced 
        level (RL) at the bottom to obtain the new height level (RL gutter or 
        fascia) at the top.<br>
        <br>
      
      <p align="center">Make up a template for recording angles and measurements.</p>
	 
      <p>The reading precision of the instrument and the accuracy of your angle 
        reading and horizontal measured distance will determine the correct height 
        distance.
