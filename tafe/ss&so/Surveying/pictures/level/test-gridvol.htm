      the instrument (level) is therefore important. The main error is where the 
      line of sight is not parallel to the horizontal line of collimation. In 
      this case your levels will not be correct. A test for checking the level 
      is known as the two peg test. This test determines the amount of error and 
      if an error occurs notify the technician (the level must be serviced).

      <p>Grid leveling is used for site investigation, for drawing contour lines 
        and for the easy calculation of volumes. 
      <div style="line-height:4pt"><br></div>
   The opposite figure shows a typical survey of a site using grid point levels. 
        The area of the site is divided into a number of squares 5&nbsp;&times&nbsp;5 
        metres (triangles or rectangles can also be used) and levels are taken 
        at corner points. The grid levels enable us to calculate the volume of 
        material above or below a certain reduced level (RL) and to draw contour 
        lines. In the example one 12.9 m contour line is shown.
<div style="line-height:50pt"><br></div>

      <div style="line-height:4pt"><br></div>

	<b>Isometric view of a building site 20 &times 20 m</b>
      <div style="line-height:4pt"><br></div>To determine volumes a grid level system is superimposed on a Lot. Figure 
      4 shows a grid level system. In the figure the grid interval is equal in 
      both directions. However, whether the interval is square or rectangular 
      depends on the contour and the lot. The area of a grid element in Figure 
      4 is 5&nbsp;m by 5&nbsp;m (25&nbsp;m&sup2;).   <div style="line-height:4pt"><br></div>
	  A reference RL <b>must</b>   
      be defined to calculate the volume of the truncated prism A, B, C, etc. 
      The volume of a grid element (A, B, C etc). is the area of the grid element 
      multiplied by the average oft the four corner heights. To calculate the 
      volume correctly each prism is to be considered on its own.
     Figure&nbsp;4 below shows the site in isometric view. As can be seen the horizontal 
        plane (green rectangle)  at RL = 12.900 lies between the RL&nbsp;=&nbsp;10.000 and RL&nbsp;=&nbsp;15.831. 
        If a house is placed on this level then  cut (blue area) equals the fill (green area). However, if the FGL (finished ground level) is at RL&nbsp;<img src="../leq.gif">&nbsp;10.00 
        then all soil of the site need to be removed and if RL&nbsp;<img src="../geq.gif">&nbsp;15.831 
        soil must be transported to the site.
      <p><img src="../iso12-9.gif"></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Figure 4</font></p>
      <p>The two grid elements <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>F</b> 
        </font>and <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>R</b></font> are 
        truncated prism of which the area is 5&nbsp;&times&nbsp;5 metres and the 
        height of the prisms is  to be the mean of the four corner heights. 
        Therefore for the volume of the prism <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>F</b></font> 
        is:<br>
        <img src="../leqat1.gif" align="left"></p>
      The volume
in the opposite equation is calculated for a  level above RL of 10 metre. The average RL numbers are therefore  reduce by 10 m. The volume of prism F is therefore 24.527 m&sup3;

	  <a name="sect4"><b>Rectangular Base Method</b> </a>
      <div style="line-height:4pt"><br>
      </div>
	   However, the 
      calculation method of the privious example can be simplified. To calculate the volume of each  separate prism would take considerable time. Instead of calculating each prism we can simplify the calculation by taking the average of all levels. <br>
              As can be seen prism<b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> F</font></b> is surrounded by other prisms and each corner must be counted four times. 
              The corners of the prism <b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">R</font></b> 
              on the other hand must be counted one (corner), two  (at the boundaries) and four (internal corner) as shown in Figure &nbsp;4.
      <div style="line-height:8pt"><br></div>
      <p>If you consider the whole lot (20 m x 20 m) and   take an average of all the grid points (25 RL's) 
        the  volume quantity would be  incorrect. Instead of calculate 16 
        single prism we could record a total of 64 points (RL's) with the number 
        occurring at each intersecting grid point as shown in Figure&nbsp;4. Each 
        corner RL occurs 1 time, all other RL's on the boundary 2 times and all 
        internal RL's 4 times.
      <div style="line-height:8pt"><br></div>
  Then the RL's need to be multiplied by the times occurring on the grid points. 
      Both columns added up and the sum of the levels is then divided by the sum 
      of the points as shown in Table 2. <br>
      A <a href="../grid%20calc%20template.xls">MS-Excel</a> program can quickly 
      do the work for you. See below for additional information and a complete 
      calculation example is shown in Table 2.

      <div style="line-height:4pt"><br></div> 
      This is even a more accurate calculation method. Triangular elements can 
      better define the surface because three levels define a plane. (A desk with 
      three legs cannot wobble which happens with four leg tables.) In this method 
      the volume is calculated of prisms with triangular bases. The calculation 
      process is similar to the above method but with a higher number occurring 
      at each intersecting grid point. Each corner RL occurs 1 or 2 times, all 
      other RL's on the boundary 3 times and all internal RL's 6 times with a 
      total of 96 occurrences.<br>

      <a name="sect7" href="contour.htm" target="_blank"><b>Contour lines</b></a>
<div style="line-height:8pt"><br></div>
	   Contour lines are an essential part of the assessment and this subject matter needs to be clearly  understood. Contour lines  are lines drawn on a plan connecting points of equal elevation. 
      If you walk along a contour line you neither gain or lose elevation. The 
      contour interval is constant for each plan. The interval will be indicated 
      for each exercise or assessment. Depending on the slope of the lot, intervals 
      can be 100 mm, 200 mm or 500 mm. 
    <div style="line-height:24pt"><br></div>
      <img src="../contouringa.gif" align=left><br>
      <br>
      Contour lines show the vertical dimension (the third dimension) of the 
        ground on site plans. The vertical distance separating contour lines gives 
        an indication of the steepness of the slopes. A few simple rules for contour 
        lines will be helpful in interpreting the vertical dimension of a building 
        site.   
      <div style="line-height:8pt"><br></div>
        In general gentle slopes are represented by widely spaced contour lines.<br>
        Steep slopes are represented by closely spaced contour lines. <br>
 <div style="line-height:8pt"><br></div>
 The contour lines shown in  Figure 7 spacing  at 500 mm interval.
  <div style="line-height:35pt"><br></div>
      <div style="text-indent:170px"> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Figure

      <div style="line-height:4pt"><br></div>
   There are two methods to plot contour lines: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) 
      by estimation &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) by calculation 
      <p>a) is the quickest method of plotting the contours. Estimate by visual 
        inspection the position of a contour between two adjacent spot levels.<div style="line-height:4pt"><br></div>
      b) is more accurate if the ground between the RL's is nearly straight. Similar 
      triangle rule is then used to calculate the contour line. <div style="line-height:4pt"><br></div>
      <p>Method a)<br>
        Contours lines are at 500 mm interval, that means there are two contour 
        lines between grid point 21 (RL 10.541) and grid point 16 (RL 11.687) the <font color="#0000ff">11.000</font> and <font color="#0000ff">11.500</font> respectively. 
        The distance between the two RL's is 5 metres. By estimation the <font color="#0000FF">11.000</font> contour line would 
        be approx. <b>0.4</b> &times 5 m <img src="approx.gif"> 2.000 m from RL 
        10.541 and the <font color="#0000ff">11.500</font> contour line would be close to RL 11.687
      <div style="line-height:4pt"><br></div>
		Method b)<br>
      We use similar triangles to to find the intersection of the contour lines 
      on the level grid. For example the difference between RL 10.541 (grid point 
      21) and RL 11.687 (grid point 16) is <b>1.146</b> metres. The difference 
      between contour line <font color="#0000FF">11.000</font> and RL 10.541 is 
      <b>0.459</b>. This figure will be used to calculate the intersection of 
      the <font color="#0000FF">11.000</font> m contour line. As the increment 
      for contour lines is 0.500&nbsp;m we add 0.500&nbsp;+&nbsp;0.459 = <b>0.959</b> 
      to find the <font color="#0000FF">11.500</font> contour line intersection. 
      <b>0.459 <b>and 0.959</b></b> is now used to find the distance <b>d1</b> 
      for the <font color="#0000FF">11.000</font> and <b>d2</b>  for the <font color="#0000FF">11.500</font> 
      contour lines. 
      <div style="line-height:4pt"><br></div>
