      <h2 ALIGN=CENTER>Using the Theodolite</h2>
	  <p>In Surveying 2 we use a theodolite to determine (read) both horizontal 
        and vertical angles to an accuracy of 20" and mark out the buildings on 
      College ground using theodolite and tape (Module requirements)</p>

      <p><img src="theo2.jpg" width="348" height="283" align="left">
      <p >A theodolite is an instrument for measuring both horizontal and vertical angles. It 
        consists of a telescope mounted movably within two perpendicular axes, 
        the horizontal and vertical axis. <br>
        All students have to use the <b>Sokkia</b> instrument. 
        as that is the only one in our department. Using the same instrument  students can learn from each other how to read scales and use all the 
        feature of the theodolite. <br>
        The left instrument in the opposit figure shows a Wild Theodolite and 
        the right instrument shows a Sokkia Theodolite</p>
     
     
      <h3><a name="1"><b>Checking a theodolite</b></a></h3>
     
        <p>A theodolite can measure angles  in both the horizontal and vertic</p>
        <p>al planes. How accurately this can be will depend partly on the quality of the instrument, and partly on the competence  of the student.
  </p>
        </p>
      <p>A theodolite may not be in perfect adjustment and the lines and planes should be checked.  To minimise error as much as possible, an angle  is measured a number of times with instrument: &#9658;<em><strong>face left</strong></em> (vertical circle on the left of the telescope) and &#9658;<em><strong>face right</strong></em> (vertical circle on the right of the telescope).
      Reading an angle face right and face left  will eliminate the errors due to the non adjustment of the line of collimation and the trunnion axis.</p>
      <p align="center">We won't do any adjustment and assume the instrument is calibrated.</p>
      
          </font>        
         Both axes of a theodolite are equipped with graduated 
            circles that can be read out through microscopes. The vertical circle 
            (the one associated with the horizontal axis!) should read 90° when 
            the sight axis is horizontal. 
            <p>A theodolite, like the Level is mounted on a tripod by means of a forced 
            centering plate or tribrach, containing three thumbscrews for rapid 
            levelling. Before use, a theodolite must be placed precisely and vertically 
        over the point to be measured.

      <h3><a name="2">Reading scales</a></h3>

      <p>Modern theodolites read the horizontal and vertical circles electronically 
        and display readings digitally as in <b>c)</b> above.
      <h3>How to read the micro-scales on the Sokkia Theodolite<img src="read-micro.gif" align="left">      </h3>
      <p> The opposite figure shows a typical view through the microscope eye 
        piece. The microscope eyepiece is located adjacent (right) to the telescope 
        eye piece. Two set of parallel lines (0&deg; and 360&deg;} are seen in 
        the H window. If the observed reading in the H-window is <img src="degree-scale.gif" width="171" height="80" align="left" vspace="15">245&deg; 
        sitting between 50' and 60' divisions you need to turn the mircometer 
        knob until the parallel 245&deg; lines are biseced by the 50' line as 
        shown in figure. Then the window above the H window will shows in the 
        top row the minute and below the seconds. The final reading as shown in 
        the figure is 245&deg; 53' 18&quot;. (The seconds reading is scaled and 
        not precise.) <br>
        The vertical circle (V-window) is read in a similar manner.

      <p><a name="3"><b>Using the Vertical Angles and the distances to determine the height.</b></a><br>
        The measured vertical angle combined with the distance to any object can 
        be used to determine the height of an object. Most modern theodolites 
        will automatically set the reference direction for the vertical circle 
        once the theodolite is leveled. Zero degrees for the vertical circle is 
        usually set at the zenith (vertically above the theodolite) and the telescpoe reading is 90&deg; when it is horizontal. The vertical 
        angle is then the angle from the zenith down to the line of observation. 
        Points on equal elevation (horizontal plane) to the theodolite will therefore 
        be at 90 degrees. Basically the precision for our vertical angle measurement 
        will determine the accuracy of measured positions. </p>
     
      <p><b>Procedures 
        to measure vertical and horizontal angles</b><br>
      <br>
      <img src="height-m.gif" width="345" height="281" align="left">
        Aim at the first specified corner of the building and <b>zero</b> the 
        horizontal circle reading. Readings for horizontal angles should be either 
        in a clock wise or anti clock wise direction. Do not change directions 
        and close the cirle at 360&deg;. Then read the vertical angles (angle 
        of elevation &amp; angle of depression) to determine the height of the 
        corner of the building. Make sure the sighting points are verticle above 
        each other. After that sight the next specified corner and read the horizontal 
        angle, and note the reading of the vertical angles.The horizontal distance 
        between all specified building corners must be exactly measured. (<font color="#000000">Note 
        the distance to</font><font color="#0000FF"> angle A</font> is different 
        to <font color="#808000">angle A</font>.) Continue reading horizontal 
        and vertical angles as well as distance measures until the specified corners 
        of all buildings are completed.

        <p><A HREF="#top">back to top</A></p>
      </div>
     <h3><a name="4">Height calculations</h3>
      We use the <i>tan-function</i> to calculate the height. As shown in the 
      figure above the height is determined by measuring two angles (angle of 
      elevation &amp; angle of depression). To calculate the Height A multiply 
      the horizontal distance on for your first height reading by the tan of the 
      related angle.

<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#808000">Height 
        A = horizontal distance x tan 90&deg;- A&deg;</font></div>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FF0000">Height 
        B = horizontal distance x tan B&deg;</font><font color="#FF0000">- 90&deg; 
        </font>
      <p>Now add both distances together. Add this measurent to the known reduced 
        level (RL) at the bottom to obtain the new height level (RL gutter or 
        fascia) at the top.<br>
      <p align="center">Make up a template for recording angles and measurements.</p>
	 
      <p>The reading precision of the instrument and the accuracy of your angle 
        reading and horizontal measured distance will determine the correct height 
        distance.
		
       
      <h3><a name="5">Using an double prism optical square  </h3>
       <p>Surveyor's use the instrument for laying out right angles and 
       placing points on line. It is a very simple geodetic instrument. The prism  has two 
       mirrors for measure right angles Figure) 1&nbsp;or in-line parallel to an object 
       using range poles (Figure 2)</p>

      <h2><a name="5">The total station</h2>
<p>All surveyors used nowadays a total station, thats consists of atheodolite with a built-in distance
 meter. It can measure angles and distances at the same time. Today’s electronic total stations all
have an opto-electronic distance meter (EDM) and electronic angle scanning ability.
