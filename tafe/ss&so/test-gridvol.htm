      <h2>Two Peg Test</h2>
      <p>All instruments are subject to errors. The checking of the instrument (level) 
        is therefore important. The main error is where the line of 
        sight is not parallel to the horizontal line of collimation. In this case your 
        levels will not be correct. A test for checking the level is known 
        as the two peg test. This test determines the amount of errror and if 
        an error occurs notif04-Jun-2020 04:59 PMid1echnician (the level must be serviced).

        <li>Establish 2 points approximately 50 metres apart on level ground as 
          shown below. Set the level half way between the 2 points.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Take the 2 staff readings. In our example an error will exists (line 
          of sight does not coincide with line of collimation).</li>

        <li>If the difference in height is the same the level is okay. If not,

      <p>Gid leveling is used for site investigation, for drawing contour line 
        and for the easy calculation of volumes. </p>
      <p>The opposite figure shows a typical survey of a site using grid levels. 
        The area of the site is divided into a number of squares 5&nbsp&times&nbsp5 
        metres (triangels or rectangles can also be used) and levels are taken 
        at corner points. The grid levels enable us to calculate the volume of 
        material above or below a certain reduced level (RL) and to draw contour 
        lines. <br>
      <pre>                  <font face=arial>Figure 3</font></pre>
      The lowest level of the site is RL&nbsp=&nbsp10.000 and the highst is RL&nbsp=&nbsp15.831<br>

      <p><b>Isometric view</b></p>
      </a> 
      <p>Figure 4 below shows the site in isometric view. As can be seen the horizontal 
        plane at RL = 12.900 lies between the RL&nbsp=&nbsp10.000 and RL&nbsp=&nbsp15.831. 
        If a house is placed on this level then some cutting and some filling 
        would be required. However, if the FGL (finished ground level) is at RL&nbsp<img src="leq.gif">&nbsp10.00 
        then all soil of the site need to be removed and if RL&nbsp<img src="geq.gif">&nbsp15.831 
        soil must be transported to the site.</p>

      <p>The two grid elements <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>F</b> 
        </font>and <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>R</b></font> are 
        truncated prism of which the area is 5&nbsp;&times&nbsp;5 metres and the 
        height of the prisms is approximated to the mean of the four corner heights. 
        Therefore for the volume of the prism <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>F</b></font> 
        is:<br>
        <img src="leqat1.gif" align="left"> To calculate the volume of each 
        separate prism would take considerable time. Instead of calculating each 
        prism we can simplify the calculation by taking the average of all levels. 
        As can be seen prism <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>F </b></font>is 
        surrounded by other prisms and each corner must be counted four times. 
        The corners of the prism <b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">R</font></b> 
        on the other hand must be counted one, two and four as shown in Figure 
        4.</p>

      <p><a name="sect4"> <b>Volume calculation</b></a></p>
      <p>The work of getting the average of the spot levels can be simplified 
        by the use of a suitable table as illustrated below: 
      <p> <img src="Table1.gif" align=left> <b>Step1</b> <br>
        Sum up the column 5 & 6 and find the mean height (MH) by dividing the 
        sum of the levels by the sum of the number of common points. 
      <pre><p>	MH = 824.999/64
	   = 12.891</pre>
      <b>Step 2</b> <br>
      Find the difference between the mean height (MH) and the proposed finish 
      ground level (FGL). <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;a) the difference can be positive &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(+ve) or negative (-ve). <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;b) if the mean height is greater &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(+ve) than the finish ground level 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(FGL) then it is a cut. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;c) if the mean height is smaller &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(-ve) than the finish ground level 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(FGL) then it is a fill . 
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp;MH 
        &#60 FGL = FILL <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MH &#62 FGL = CUT <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MH = FGL then CUT = FILL </font> </p>
      <p><b>Step 3</b> <br>
        Multiply the difference (from Step 2) with the area of the lot to find the required 
        volume.</p><br> 
      <p>In the isometric view the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">FGL&nbsp;=&nbsp;12.900</font><br>
        Therefore from <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">MH</font> Step 
        2&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">12.891-12.900=&nbsp;<b>-</b> 
        0.009</font><br>
        The MH (12.891) &#60 FGL (12.900) therefore some fill is required. The 
        fill that is required is minimal because the FGL &#126 MH. The amount 
        of fill is <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">0.009 &times 400 
        = 3.6 m²</font><br>

      <a name="sect5"><b>Contour lines</b> </a> 
      <p><img src="contouringa.gif" align=left><br>
        A contour line is an imaginary line that links up a series of points of 
        the same level on the earth surface. Contour lines show the vertical dimension 
        (the third dimension) of the ground on site plans. The vertical distance 
        separating contour lines gives an indication of the steepness of the slopes. 
        A few simple rules for contour lines will be helpful in interpreting the 
        vertical dimension of a building site.<br>
        Gentle slopes are represented by widely spaced contour lines.<br>
        Steep slopes are represented by closely spaced contour lines. <br>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Figure 
        5</font></p>
      <p>There are two ways to plot contour lines: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) 
        by estimation &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) by calculation</p>
      <p>a) is the quickest method of plotting the contours. Estimate by visual 
        inspection the position of a contour between two adjacent spot levels.</p>
      <p>b) is more accurate. Similar triangle rule is used to calculate the contour 
        line. This principle is show in Figure&nbsp6 below and is generally used 
        for all your exercises and Assignments.</p>
