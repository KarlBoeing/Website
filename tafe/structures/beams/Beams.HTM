<b>Performance of beams</b>
</font>
<p>A beam is a structural member designed to support various loading applied at points along the member. When a beam is loaded it will bend and this bendin is measured in newton millimetre or multiples of the units (e.g. kNm.).
The forces applied to a beam are counteracted by the supports which are called reactions (RL left support and RR right support)</p>

<p><b>Reaction types</b></p>
<p>Beams are usually supported on walls piers or columns which provide the necessary equilibrium. (According to Newton’s third law there is for every action an equal and opposite reaction.)
In simple terms the load on the beam is the action and the supports provide the reaction. There are three different support reaction:</p>

<p>Figure 1</p>
<p>Type (a) accommodate three reaction, (b) one reaction and type (c) two reaction</p>
<p><b>Beam types</b></p>
<p>In this subject we will consider only simply supported beams which can be determinate completely with the three static equation. Continuous beams are beyond the scope of this subject. The two beam types are that we will use are shown below.</p>

<p>Figure 2</p>
<p><b>Loading types</b></p>
<p>Beams are subjected to uniformly distributed loads (UDL), point (concentrated) loads or a combination of both. The various loading conditions to which a beam may be subjected to are shown below.</p>

simple structures (statically determinate) can be completely analysed.
<p>
To calculate the reaction of beams we use the equation &#931 M = 0</p>

<p>The <b>Shear force</b> at any cross-section of the beam is equal to the algebraic sum of the external forces acting on one side of the section only.</p>

<p>The <b>Bending moment</b>, at any point of the beam, is equal to the algebraic sum of the moments (taken about the point) of the external forces (loads & reactions) on one side of the section only.</p>
<p><b>Units</b></p>
<p>The <b>unit of bending moment</b> is the same as for <b>moment of a force</b>, i.e. the newton metre (Nm) and multiples and submultiples of this unit.</p>

<br>
3 Redraw the two ‘parts’ of the beam; and draw the internal forces on the cut end of the beam portion to keep the system in balance<br>

<p>There are to unknowns (R<sub>L</sub> and R<sub>R</sub>) and one must be eliminated to be able to calculate the reaction. We select the rotation point at R<sub>R</sub> because reaction R<sub>R</sub> times distance is then zero.<br>
To find R<sub>L</sub> take the moment about R<sub>R</sub> (now there is only one unknown in our equation)</p>

<p>The principle to calculate the reaction is similar to the example above.
The uniformly distributed load can be substituted by a concentrated load acting in the centre of gravity of the UDL.</p>

<p>The total load on beam is the UDL multiplied by the length of the beam,
i.e. <br>5 kN/m &#215 8.00 m = 40 kN.<br>The centre of gravity of the UDL is at<br>
 ½ of 8.00 m = 4.00 m</p>

<p>As symetrie exists there is no need to calculate the reaction. From inspection it can be seen that<br>
R<sub>L</sub> =  R<sub>R</sub> = 40 kN/2 = 20 kN</p>

<p>For every load on a beam, there is a critical point at which a maximum bending moment occurs. The diagrams clearly indicate that this point is at zero shear. In other words where zero shear occurs there is the maximum bending moment.</p>

<p><b>Deflection</b></p>
<p>The factors that influence the deflection have been discussed previously. A constant factor that depends on the loading of the beam is introduced in the deflection equation above.</p>
      <p align="center"><b>Note:</b> that in the deflection formula for UDL <b>w</B> is the load per metre, (in above equation<br>
         <b>w &#215  <i>l<sup>4</sup></i></b>), if  <b>W</b> = total load (w &#215 <i>l</i>) then<b> W &#215 <i>l<sup>3</sup></i></b> must be used in the equation above.
