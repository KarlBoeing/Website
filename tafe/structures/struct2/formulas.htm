      <p>The formula for simple stress is: </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="equa1.gif"></p>
      <p>The formula for strain is:</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="equa2.gif"></p>
      <p><font size="-1">(Strain is a dimensionless figure)</font></p>
      <p>The formula for bending stress is:</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="equa3.gif"></p>
      <p>The bending stress depends on the shape of the member resisting the tress. 
        The following formula is used to calculate the section modulus:</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="equa4.gif"></p>
      <p>The section modulus is derived from the second moment of area also known 
        as moment of inertia (I)</p>

      <p>The Modulus of Elasticity or Young's Modulus, (<b>E</b>), is a measure 
        of the resistance of an elastic material to being stretched or shortened. 
        Elastic materials obey Hooke's Law, which states that stress is proportional 
        to strain, provided the elastic limit of the material is not exceeded. 
        Shortening or lengthening of the material will be less the greater the 
        value of E is. E is needed for the calculation of deflections. </p>
      <p>The formula for Modulus of Elasticity (Young's Modulus) is:</p>

      <h3 align="center"> UNITS </h3>
      <p> Without Units any calculations are meaningless. An answer without units 
        is a <b>wrong</b> answer. To demonstrate the important of units consider 
        the following example: 
      <p align="center"> <i><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">If 
        someone borrows from you $10 and later repays you with 10 cents you would 
        not be pleased, because 10 cents are much less worth than $10.</font></i></p>
      <p>Although the figure 10 in both cases occur and if this is correct you 
        will definitely agree that without units your answer will be senseless.<br>
        It is important to think about unit before you start your calculation. 
        All units in equations must be compatible. Whatever unit you may select, 
        you must make sure that this unit will be used throughout your calculation. 
        (You cannot multiply meter by millimetre) </p>
