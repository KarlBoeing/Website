Mathematics is used to support principles rather than to define them as done in Structures 1. Structures 2 is of an advance level and students must not have any difficulties with the following: 
<ul>
<li>Fractions (common and decimal)
<li>Ratio and proportions	
<li>Scientific notation
<li>Trigonometric functions (sin, cos. & tan)
<li>First degree equations
<li>Formula transposition</ul>
<p>The study of Structure 2 subject of the National Course provide the students with a greater depth of knowledge of general structural principles. The Learning Outcomes deal with forces and moments, properties and behaviour of structural materials, section properties, beams, columns, structural connections, bracing, trusses and loads as in Structures 1. Mathematics will be used to support structural principles.</p>

<p>
In Structures 2 you must be familiar with terms, units and Greek symbols (letters).</p>
      <p>We also construct structural models, which will be analysed and tested. These exercises can be  
        great fun and student usually enjoy doing them. See picture below.
